<h3>Specializing in Acupuncture for Women's Health & Chronic Ailments</h3>

<p>Inger ("Inga") Giffin, L.Ac.  opened Wisdom Ways Acupuncture in 2008 with the goal of helping women to achieve the best physical and mental health of their lives through the use of Acupuncture, Chinese herbs, and nutritional guidance.</p>
<p>Her primary training was first in California — which has the most rigorous requirements in the US — and then continued in China at one of the top schools in the country.  She now brings almost 20 years of clinical experience to her work.</p>
<p>But aside from her training and experience, we know what really matters is finding an acupuncturist who’s a good fit for YOU. To figure out if that might be Inger, in addition to watching her short intro video and checking out her personal and conditions treated pages, scroll down to check out her blog.</p>
<p>Her blog writings reflect the two things we hear over and over are unique about Inger: first, her focus on “educational medicine”; and second, her extremely thorough & holistic approach, continuously drawing together aspects of the emotional, physical, spiritual, and nutritional, depending on the need that day.</p>
<p>Humans are deep and multi-faceted beings, and health — and therefore healing — must be as well!</p>
