    <p>Before I started acupuncture, I was anxious and on edge all the time,
    and having two panic attacks almost every week. Then, I'd have to deal
    with the stomach cramping and bowel problems for days after. Almost
    immediately with the acupuncture my panic attacks decreased by about half,
    and I started feeling calmer and less high strung. I used to not be able
    to settle down, and would irritate everyone around me with my constant
    fidgeting. My bowels also got much more normal and I wouldn&rsquo;t have
    the constipation and diarrhea. I started decreasing my treatments once my
    panic attacks went away completely, and even though sometimes I feel like
    I'll get one if I have a major project coming up, now I&rsquo;m able to
    calm myself down on my own, or I just schedule a treatment the week I know
    I'll be under more stress, and it takes care of it. I love my
    acupuncture!</p>

    <p>My husband and I had been trying for about 3 years to get pregnant, 2
    of those just by not trying to NOT get pregnant, but the last year with
    much stressful dedication. I also had a lot of anxiety. We were headed
    towards looking at IVF treatment but due to the costs and stress
    associated with the procedure, we thought we&rsquo;d try Chinese medicine
    first. I started acupuncture and within 3 cycles we were pregnant! The
    added bonus was that I was so much more calm from the treatment.
    We&rsquo;re now shooting for number two, and will be back to acupuncture
    if we have troubles again!</p>

    <p>My IBS got really bad last year after a really hard and stressful time.
    I started getting acupuncture, and even after the first treatment for the
    first time in months I didn&rsquo;t have diarrhea.&nbsp; After a few weeks
    of getting treatment the results started lasting longer and now I
    don&rsquo;t really feel like I even&nbsp; have IBS.</p>

    <p>Thank you, Inger, for your willingness to take the time to look at all
    the different aspects involved with my healing. I&rsquo;ve never had a
    health care provider spend so much time with me, and really considering
    not just my symptoms, but foods, my stress levels, the way I&rsquo;m
    living my life, the amount of stress I let myself live in, etc.
    You&rsquo;ve helped me see health in a bigger picture, and I&rsquo;m
    better for it. Thank you!</p>

    <p>I started acupuncture after getting diagnosed with lupus.&nbsp; I
    absolutely refused to go on the steroids that they wanted to give me, and
    am so grateful to have found Inger instead.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m managing my
    symptoms completely with acupuncture and nutrition, and for the most part,
    I feel almost like I did before getting sick now. Inger was the only
    health care person on my &ldquo;team&rdquo; to even mention the nutrition
    and food connections with auto-immunity, but her advise in this realm has
    helped me immensely.</p>

    <p>I was literally afraid I was dying when I went to see Inger for
    acupuncture. I had so many weird symptoms and no doctors could explain
    them. All my tests were turning out normal, and while each one was relief,
    as time went on and I just started feeling worse, it almost became more
    frustrating that everything was turning out &ldquo;fine&rdquo;. I was
    &ldquo;fine&rdquo;. But I wasn&rsquo;t fine. I felt crappy ALL THE TIME.
    At my first acupuncture treatment, after listening to my long list of
    weird, hard to explain symptoms, Inger didn&rsquo;t seem surprised at all
    to hear them all. When she was even able to guess some of my other weird
    symptoms, and seemed to know exactly what they were related to, I felt my
    body relax for the first time in months. Somehow, from an energetic
    perspective, she was able to explain how it all tied together, and when
    she explained the cause of it all I could just relate to everything she
    was saying. She was using weird terms I&rsquo;d never heard of, but
    somehow, it made sense. And, she seemed completely confident that it would
    resolve, knew exactly what we needed to do to get there, and we came up
    with a plan.&nbsp; It was like she saw this stuff everyday. Sure enough,
    even after the first treatment, my head was just clearer. It was like a
    fog was lifted and I could think again. My energy stabilized. And as the
    weeks progressed, one by one my symptoms just disappeared. I&rsquo;m not
    perfect yet. I still have some things we&rsquo;re working on, but even
    those are night and day different from when I started. When my doctors
    tell me it must all be a coincidence, because acupuncture isn&rsquo;t
    &ldquo;proven&rdquo;, I just chuckle inside.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve had chronic digestive issues since I was a kid. I&rsquo;ve
    been on numerous drugs, some which would help for a little while, some
    which didn&rsquo;t help at all.&nbsp; My digestive symptoms started
    improving right after I started acupuncture, and are almost completely
    gone now, 2 months after starting treatment. If I do get a flare-up,
    it&rsquo;s invariably because I accidentally ate something that we figured
    out is causing problems. I&rsquo;m also much more relaxed and calm since I
    started, which was an unexpected side effect. I really love my
    treatments.</p>

    <p>I started seeing Inger for heavy bleeding and really irregular periods
    related to the start of menopause.&nbsp; My doctor told me my only option
    was a hysterectomy or cauterization because none of the hormones were
    stopping it.&nbsp; We did herbs and acupuncture together, and my bleeding
    stopped almost immediately. Then we continued with acupuncture and my
    periods completely normalized over the next few cycles. The PMS that had
    gotten really bad over the past couple years almost completely went away,
    to the point that I can&rsquo;t even tell my period is coming now, until I
    start bleeding.</p>

    <p>I have a baby!&nbsp; I call her my acupuncture baby. I had been doing
    ART of one sort or another for 1.5 years before finally trying
    acupuncture. I didn&rsquo;t really believe it could work because I
    couldn&rsquo;t understand how sticking some needles in me and taking herbs
    could really change anything if my eggs weren&rsquo;t good quality. But we
    had spent more money than I want to admit on all the western stuff, and we
    agreed we&rsquo;d give the Chinese medicine 6 months, and then give up and
    look at adoption.&nbsp; Four and a half months later, I conceived
    naturally, and my baby girl is a healthy 3 month old now.&nbsp; The best
    part is, I hadn&rsquo;t really been feeling well for many years before the
    infertility came up, I was fatigued, didn&rsquo;t sleep well, and got bad
    headaches a few times almost every week. The ART just made it all
    worse.&nbsp; Now, I not only have my girl, but all those symptoms are
    gone. I had a great pregnancy and feel that I have the health and energy
    to really be there for my daughter.</p>

    <p>Inger got rid of the headache I&rsquo;d had for three weeks straight,
    at the first appointment. Now we&rsquo;re working on them not coming back,
    and it&rsquo;s amazing that I&rsquo;m not taking any medication at all but
    somehow it&rsquo;s working. ??&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been seeing her for about
    a month now, and my headaches are about 75% less than when I came in. I am
    SO excited to see how this is going to turn out!</p>

    <p>My life is so different since I started acupuncture. It was to the
    point where I was on so many medications that I had to write them down on
    a spreadsheet to remember when to take them all.&nbsp; Somehow, I just
    knew something wasn&rsquo;t right about this. The fact that I wasn&rsquo;t
    really feeling any better on them really made me feel bad.&nbsp; I felt
    like I was just &lsquo;existing&rsquo;. I couldn&rsquo;t even do the
    things I loved anymore, and to be honest, I couldn&rsquo;t even remember
    what it felt like to care. My life was spiraling quickly downward. On a
    whim, I started researching online and found Inger. Long story short,
    I&rsquo;m off all my medications except 2, and I found a doctor who would
    support me in the more natural approach I&rsquo;m trying to take with
    Inger.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m feeling better than I ever did on all those
    medications. I&rsquo;m still working on lifestyle changes, which is hard,
    but even when I&rsquo;m not perfect the acupuncture is helping everything
    feel better, and that encourages me. I wish more people knew about how
    much this can help them.</p>

    <p>I had &lsquo;tried everything&rsquo; for my migraines when I finally
    decided I had nothing to lose by finding an acupuncturist. I started
    asking around, and finally heard of someone else with migraines who had
    gone to Inger.&nbsp; I made my appointment, and that is the day everything
    started changing for me. I was literally at the point of being completely
    dysfunctional and it was only getting worse. Now, I have the day of my
    first appointment marked on my calendar with a big red circle, and my
    husband and I go out to dinner every year as an anniversary, to celebrate
    my mostly migraine-free life! I&rsquo;m coming up on the three year
    anniversary of starting acupuncture. It&rsquo;s probably the thing that
    has had the biggest impact on my health, that I&rsquo;ve ever done for
    myself.</p>

    <p>At my first treatment, Inger explained that this wasn&rsquo;t really a
    good medicine for people who just wanted something &lsquo;done to
    them&rsquo; to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; them. She explained that this was team
    work, and that we were equal partners on the journey of my healing.
    Honestly, that was about the last thing I was wanting to hear at that
    stage. I was pretty committed to my lifestyle at that point, so I have to
    admit that even though I felt pretty good after my first appointment, it
    took me a while to reschedule another one.&nbsp; I LIKED my busy life that
    required the convenience of frozen foods. I LIKED my diet sodas! For about
    6 more months I went to other doctors again, who gave me prescriptions.
    That made me really happy&hellip;until they didn&rsquo;t work. So when I
    got sick and tired enough of feeling sick and tired, and realized it was
    only me who could make this better, I rescheduled.&nbsp; That, my friends,
    is when I finally started getting better.&nbsp; Like, REAL better. Not
    just temporary symptoms masked by pills as others are sprouting up.&nbsp;
    Now, we are truly a team. She helps me feel better, and I help myself feel
    better too.</p>

    <p>From my entire Chronic Fatigue support group, we all together say THANK
    YOU for the work you&rsquo;re doing, and your dedication to walking with
    people through their most difficult times. We have so much respect for
    your obvious passion for the medicine, for your commitment to keep on
    learning, and your encouragement to us all. We can speak as a group when
    we say that you helped us all remember who we are&hellip;people who now
    remember what it feels like to feel alive again.&nbsp; Some of us felt
    immediate improvement, while others progressed more slowly, but across the
    board we all noticed change happening once we started treatment.&nbsp;
    Thank you so&nbsp; much for being here for us all! You have been so much
    more than just a health care provider for us, you stand out as a bright
    light in our long, difficult healing process.</p>

    <p>Endometriosis runs in my family. It&rsquo;s so bad that my mother and
    one sister both had hysterectomies.&nbsp; Luckily, I have a twin who heard
    about acupuncture for endometriosis and went to Inger because her friend
    had had good results.&nbsp; I figured I&rsquo;d watch how she did, and if
    she felt better, I&rsquo;d go too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m really young still, and
    want to be able to have kids and I was getting really depressed thinking
    about surgery as my only option. So of course I went, and I think in the
    second treatment we started herbs.&nbsp; Eight months later, I&rsquo;m
    almost symptom free.&nbsp; I still go for &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;
    treatments around my period, and take herbs. At this point, I&rsquo;m so
    happy with the improvement that even if I had to do this for life, it
    would be way better than any other option. Especially because I
    don&rsquo;t even mind going in, my treatments are like my &ldquo;spa
    days&rdquo; for myself, because they&rsquo;re so relaxing and help the
    irritability I can get at my period.&nbsp; Not a bad option if you ask
    me!</p>

    <p>When it finally got to the point where the only medication that would
    make a dent in my migraines was one my insurance wouldn&rsquo;t cover and
    one pill was the cost of a nice dinner out, I started looking into other
    options.&nbsp; I found Inger and had three acupuncture treatments that
    first week because they were so bad.&nbsp; By my third acupuncture, I went
    4 days without a migraine for the first time in months. After that I came
    in twice per week for several weeks and was much better, having less
    migraines and the ones I got were less intense.&nbsp; When I got to the
    point where I was only getting them around my periods, we backed down to
    once per week, and now, I only get them when I PMS if it&rsquo;s been a
    really stressful month.&nbsp; The thing I didn&rsquo;t expect, was how
    much better I felt in general.&nbsp; I never paid much attention to my
    body before seeing Inger, but she taught me about the different between
    coping and thriving.&nbsp; Before, I would run my body into the ground and
    as long as there was a pill that would take my migraines away, I
    didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; Now, I know what it feels like to actually feel
    great.&nbsp; Good energy, I sleep better, and I crave healthier
    foods.&nbsp; And, Inger&rsquo;s just really nice, so I always look forward
    to my treatments!</p>

    <p>I came for acupuncture after meeting another woman with Lyme Disease
    who said Inger&rsquo;s treatment had been the only thing that
    helped.&nbsp; I had been diagnosed with Lyme Disease 2 years ago and life
    as I knew it had stopped.&nbsp; I had to quit my job and go on
    disability.&nbsp; I had no energy and was in constant pain in my muscles,
    as well as a heavy burning pain in my upper body.&nbsp; I never used to be
    anxious but ever since the Lyme I had severe anxiety.&nbsp; I went through
    the whole western treatment but nothing was helping, and I thought
    I&rsquo;d never feel well again.&nbsp; As soon as I started acupuncture,
    the heavy burning feelings improved, and I could do more things without
    needing a nap.&nbsp; I slowly and gradually, but very noticeably, started
    improving all around, and even though it took several months to feel back
    to myself, everything started changing once I started Chinese Medicine.
    Inger also helped me understand the foods I needed to eat to heal, and
    gave me the right herbs to get the Lyme out of my system. I&rsquo;m so
    grateful that I started this process, it scares me to think about where
    I&rsquo;d be now if I hadn&rsquo;t found her.</p>

    treatment.&nbsp; But the rest is hard to put a finger on.&nbsp; You say
    it&rsquo;s &ldquo;balance&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t really know what that
    means, but it must be what I&rsquo;m feeling.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t had to
    take a nap since I started coming in&hellip;I feel like I&rsquo;ve gotten
    my life back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so glad that this medicine is making

    <p>When I first went in to see Inger, I was &ldquo;flashing&rdquo; about
    20 times a day!&nbsp; My husband would say he could feel my heat from
    about 3 feet away.&nbsp; She immediately put me on herbs and gave me an
    acupuncture treatment.&nbsp; The next time I came in, 3 days later, my
    flashes had gone down to about 3 or 4 a day and my husband couldn&rsquo;t
    feel my heat anymore.&nbsp; He was so impressed that he ended up coming in

    <p>I had felt so bad for so long, that I was giving up.&nbsp; My
    fibromyalgia pain made it so that all I could do was lay around in
    bed.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t even raise my own kids, we had people helping
    us with everything.&nbsp; Then, I met someone at church who had gone to
    Inger for acupuncture for&nbsp; fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue.&nbsp;
    She said after a handful of months of acupuncture and herbs, she was
    probably about 75% better, and she&rsquo;s still getting better with her
    treatments.&nbsp; Sometimes I have setbacks for a couple weeks here and
    there,&nbsp; which Inger explained was normal.&nbsp; But overall I can
    definitely say my life has taken a huge turn since starting my treatments,
    and now I know I will get better, because it&rsquo;s already happening. I
    got rid of my kid&rsquo;s after school helper and now I cook dinner for my
    family every day and can take them to their events. I have a lot of other
    people in my family who are also very grateful for Inger for the work she

    always get a relaxing nap when I have my acupuncture.</p>
