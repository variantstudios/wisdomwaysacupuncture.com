If you’re considering starting acupuncture for fertility, this blog will help you understand what exactly Chinese medicine helps with in all the various phases of your hormone cycle.

The main gist of what we’re doing is supporting the normal function of what SHOULD be happening in each phase. Women who have normal menstrual cycles where everything happens when it should, and how it should, usually won’t have problems with fertility.

When women first start fertility treatment, it’s normal and expected that these functions are impaired. So if we can simply fix these issues in all the various phases, many women’s infertility is fixed as well.

### Do all fertility treatment plans look exactly like that list below?

The process outlined below is a general overview of the functions that happen at each phase of the cycle, and what treatment during that phase works on.

But depending on our assessment and diagnosis – which tells us where your problems are likely occurring – we design a plan that will customize treatment for exactly what you need.

Remember! This is a very general overview.

For example, if a woman is extremely cold all the time and has hypo/under-functioning of her organs in general (what we might diagnose as yang deficiency), then we’d be working on that the entire cycle, along with the other things we’re working to fix in the various phases.

A woman who is Yin Deficient – a generic example would be someone who is hot all the time, dry, tends to ovulate early – would need her yin addressed her entire cycle as well, not just in the “yin phase” listed below.

## Here are the menstrual phases, what’s occurring in your body in each phase, and what the treatment goals are for each phase

#### Phase I: Menses

Thorough endometrial shedding, for better implantation sites

&nbsp;

#### Phase 2: Follicular phase

##### What’s happening:

* Estrogen from growing follicle primes the endometrium (estrogen receptors on endometrium)
* As estrogen increases, FSH is secreted, 1-2 follicles become dominant, LH levels increase which causes ovulation. In HEALTHY system, the process of selection of dominant follicle til ovulation, takes FIVE DAYS. If it takes longer than that, it means the egg quality isn’t good

##### Treatment goals:

* Nourish yin/estrogen/cervical secretions
* Nourish egg in follicle: 10-30 should grow, 1-2 should become dominant
* Encourage good microcirculation to ovaries and uterus for good nutrition/oxygen to eggs, as well as to build good vasculature for uterus

#### &nbsp;

#### Phase 3: Ovulation

##### What’s happening:

* LH trigger and egg is released

##### Treatment goals:

* Regulate Qi and Blood, so:
  * Egg can be released
  * Fallopian tubes can reach out and grab
  * Egg will be held up for just the right amount of time for proper maturation, in tube
* Clear damp
* Promote yang:
  * To improve temp/progesterone rise
  * Help egg move

#### Phase 4 EARLY: Luteal phase

##### What’s happening:

* Egg is maturing in tubes
* Tubal secretions must be perfect for timing of egg maturity

##### Treatment goals:

* Acupuncture is very important in this phase if there’s stagnation and/or dampness: we keep qi in pelvic area moving well

#### Phase 4 LATE: Implantation window in Luteal Phase

##### What’s happening:

* blastocyte enters uterus 5 days after ovulation.

##### IMPLANTATION WINDOW:

* Adheres to lining 6-7 days after ovulation. Takes 3 days to implant after adhering. So, 9-11 days after ovulation, it’s implanted
* new cells and vessels are developing, need good microcirculation, endometrium is becoming more vascular
* acceptance of embryo by mom

##### Treatment goals:

* Just small gentle bits of movement with acupuncture
