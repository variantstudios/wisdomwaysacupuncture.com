If you’ve gone through the horrible experience of multiple miscarriages, then you’ve probably been tested for blood clotting factors.

While western medicine doesn’t really have any great treatments for this, Chinese medicine really excels at helping this condition.

That’s because we recognize the underlying cause as an imbalance that we commonly treat every day: Blood Stagnation. And we have very effective ways to address it using both acupuncture and herbs.

I’ll get back to that later, but first, I want to go over 2 types of Factors that affect miscarriage.

## Genetic and Immune Factors and why they’re important to fertility

&nbsp;

#### [Genetic Factors/thrombophelias](https://www.newyorkfertilityservices.com/causes-of-infertility/recurrent-miscarriage/clotting-disorders-recurrent-miscarriage/){: target="_blank"}

* Prothrombin
* MTHFR hypercysteinemia
* Factor V

#### Immune:

* Auto-immunity
* APA: Antiphospholipid Antibodies
* Antinuclear antibodies
* Natural Killer Cells
* Cytotoxic B cells
* Blocking antibodies

I could devote numerous long blogs to each one of these factors, but since google has a wealth of information on each topic, for this post I’ll just list some of the ways these factors impair fertility, then I’ll move to how we treat it in the clinic.

### The summary is that these factors interfere with blood flow

They:

* Attack blood vessels
* Cause blood clotting, which interferes with microcirculation in the reproductive organs
* Attack the “glue” for the placenta to form, impairing its growth
* Impair implantation, affecting the establishment of pregnancy

### How do we address this with acupuncture and herbs?

As I mentioned before, “Blood Stagnation”/“blood stasis” is an issue acupuncturists work with every day. Even without western tests to alert us to issues with clotting factors, the body gives us a wealth of signs and symptoms to tell us that we need to help this problem.

Women with blood flow issues often have these common symptoms:

* Bad menstrual cramps
* Large clots in their menstrual blood, that are usually brown or purple in color, or black in extreme cases
* If they have headaches or other body pain, the quality tends to be sharp stabbing
* They might be prone to moles or other skin discolorations
* Their tongue diagnosis will reveal a purplish hue, and there might be dark dots on it
* Their Basal Body Temperature ([BBT) often doesn’t drop right when their period arrives.](/2018/07/01/fertility-basal-body-temperature-does-your-temperature-not-drop-when-your-period-comes/)

How I work with blood stasis

If I ever see a fertility patient with these issues, and especially if she’s already had 1 or more miscarriages, I STRONGLY caution her against trying to get pregnant until these signs and symptoms have improved. The chances of miscarrying again are extremely high unless these issues are corrected.

Luckily, Chinese medicine is excellent at correcting this issue and I’ve seen many women with multiple miscarriages go on to have healthy babies. IF they postpone pregnancy until we have good reason to believe that the issues are resolved.

There are even some acupuncture fertility experts who make patients sign a contract agreeing to do everything possible to NOT get pregnant for usually 3 months, so they have time to help prevent another miscarriage. And they refuse to take them on as patients if they won’t agree to delay pregnancy attempts.

I don’t go that far, but sometimes I wish I did. Because however heartwrenching it is for me to see my patients go through yet another miscarriage, it’s of course even worse for her. The fact that she was forewarned doesn’t make it any easier. So I do my best to encourage delaying attempts at conception when I see these Blood stagnation issues.

Each Immune related miscarriage increases your chance of miscarrying again, exponentially

Immune related miscarriages are particularly nasty, because the body can actually start developing antibodies to its own growing fetus. And each time a miscarriage happens, the antibody numbers increase, which means the next pregnancy has an even greater chance of miscarrying. It’s a horrible viscious cycle.

<br>IF we don’t treat the blood stagnation. If we do, then these numbers look way better.

Do you have any of those signs and symptoms and you’re just starting your attempts at pregnancy?

If you recognize yourself in any of the symptoms listed above, then you’re probably at a higher risk of having blood stasis related pregnancy issues. It would be a good idea to address those issues before attempts at pregnancy.
