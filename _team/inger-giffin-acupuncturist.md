From a very young age I've been both inspired and fascinated by the amazing healing wisdom of the body, so when I discovered acupuncture many years ago, it quickly became not just a job or even a career, but rather a life calling. It's become my Life Purpose to learn everything I can about the body's innate ability to heal, so that I can help other women nurture that ability in their own bodies as well.

My clinical experience began in 1997 in a non-profit women's health clinic. This clinic was founded during the women's health movement under the principles of equality, respect, and empowerment of women; and every employee was still taught that regardless of our role there, we were all fundamentally patient advocates. Underneath every role we performed, our ultimate job was to empower women with health education and resources, so they could take their health into their own hands and be less reliant on outside help for remaining healthy.  We were to create a comfortable, non-intimidating environment where women could bring all their concerns and be heard with compassion.

Almost 20 years later I haven't forgotten my roots, and the goal of empowerment through education and advocacy is an inseparable part of everything I do.

Rather than treating everything that presents itself to me, I have limited my practice to focusing on treating those conditions for which I am most excited: women's health, natural fertility, and the complex combination of chronic internal medical conditions which I see so often in today's women.

By narrowly focusing my training, studies, and clinical work for several years, I have been able to improve my success rates for these conditions dramatically; all while increasing my confidence in this medicine's ability to help even the worst of these conditions. The more I learn, I can absolutely say the more humbled I become by the absolute beauty and power of this old medicine.

### Primary and Continued Acupuncture Training

I am extremely grateful that I was able to obtain my primary Chinese Medical education in California, because the rigorous requirements there set me up with the foundations necessary to practice with a level of complexity that I feel is necessary for the types of conditions I treat.

I'm constantly continuing my studies, most recently focusing on Classical Medicine and deepening my many years of work with the complex practice of customized herbal formulas -- which in China is a primary treatment for most of the conditions I treat. I'm currently in an advanced 2-year Classical Medicine study program, and am always applying this new knowledge to my challenging cases. In this way, by digging deeper and deeper into the medicine, I am often able to help even the most stubborn, confusing cases.
Through my studies, I continue to grow more committed by the year to delve deeper into this medicine to unlock its secrets, and every morning I wake up excited to learn more about this medicine that I witness doing "miracles" everyday in the clinic.

### Acupuncture & Educational Medicine that empowers

I am by nature an educator. Because of my love of learning, and my personal experience of knowing how important knowledge is in empowering healthy choices, a big emphasis in my practice is what I call "educational medicine".  Meaning, it's very important for me to make sure patients understand how we're seeing the body and its problems from our very different Chinese medical perspective, so that people can know what holistic aspects influenced the problem in the first place and unique ways of helping to improve it on their own outside the treatment room. I've even invented a new word for how I am in the treatment room when discussing a case with a patient, and that's "explainy". :-)

I often hear that my thorough approach, detailed questions, constant return to the bigger holistic picture, personal background with deep emotional/spiritual healing, as well as the time I take explaining things; take the work to a completely different, and deeper, level.

### My personal life
Alas, life isn't just about work! Besides being an acupuncturist, I'm also a complete foodie, and am just as passionate about whole, real, scrumptious, nourishing foods, as I am about Chinese Medicine. 

I also love nature, and outside of work you'll find me and my long-time Significant Other, as well as our wonderdoggie Nissa, hiking or backpacking out in our beautiful CO mountains! You also might find us in our garden as we're in the middle of a several-year install of a Permaculture Food Forest. Eventually we hope to grow all our own food, as well as raise chickens and rabbits. 

You also just might find me at a local yarn store or sitting at home by the fire knitting up something fun with hand-died artisanal yarns! I'm a voracious reader too, and love learning about history through historical fiction. I love world travel and have been to 27 different countries; the most interesting trip was the year I sold everything and took a year off to do a solo-trek across Latin America. Lastly, I fancy myself a recreational runner as well, and usually do at least one 10K a year.

(p.s.: I'm also  TOTAL HARRY POTTER FAN!!!) :-P
