Since 2014, when someone calls the clinic, Liz's has been the happy voice heard on the other end of the line. She handles almost all the administrative tasks associated with running the office, including the Insurance Billing.

Liz is passionate about wellness herself, having studied Holistic Nutrition and most recently embarking on a yoga teacher training. She graduated from Denver University with a degree in Environmental Science.

In her free time, you'll find her in a yoga studio, in the mountains hiking, or harvesting produce from her first ever veggie garden!

Patients are constantly commenting on how awesome and helpful Liz is, and she's certainly been a huge asset to the clinic.
