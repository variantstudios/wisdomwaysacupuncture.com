Since 2014, when someone calls the clinic, Liz's has been the happy voice heard on the other end of the line. She handles almost all of the administrative tasks associated with running the office, including the Insurance Billing.

Liz is passionate about wellness herself, and is currently studying Holistic Nutrition. She graduated from Denver University with a degree in Environmental Science.

In her free time, you'll find her in a yoga studio, in the mountains hiking, or riding around on her new motorcycle! :-)

Patients are constantly commenting on how awesome and helpful Liz is, and she's been a huge asset to the clinic!
