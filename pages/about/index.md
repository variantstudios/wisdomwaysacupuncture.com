Dr. Mellin, "Doc Rick", is a third generation Weld County resident.  He grew up in the Greeley area, graduating from Platte Valley High School in 1983.  He attended, and received his dental degree from the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio.  From there he returned to Colorado completing a 1 year residency in general practice at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver.  Once again he and his wife left Colorado for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  Over the course of the next 6 years he completed his specialty training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and graduated from Mayo Medical School.  Dr. Mellin then chose to return to Greeley vs. pursuing a career at the Mayo Clinic.  He joined fellow Mayo alum, Dr Bryan Ericson, in Greeley in July of 1997.  He celebrated his 20th year of serving Greeley, Weld County, and Northeastern Colorado in July of 2017.

The Mellins feel it is a privilege to be part of the Greeley community.  They try to support several charitable organizations, and you can count on seeing them supporting the boys and girls of Northeastern Colorado by their attendance at athletic, theater, and music events.  Dr. Mellin has attended more than 20 State Championship events that his patients have participated in.  This can be appreciated by seeing all the high school memorabilia he has collected and has on display ot his office.
