# Services Offered

In my clinic I primarily use a combination of Acupuncture and customized Chinese herbal formulas. Because of the nature of conditions I treat, almost 100% my patients are put on an herbal formula, if they're open to it.

Acupuncture or herbs can be used individually; however, the combination of the two has proven to be the best, and fastest, route to recovery.

Click the links above or the navigation tabs at the top, to find out more about each of these treatments, and how I work with them.

In addition to Acupuncture and herbs, if I feels that nutritional guidance/changes are necessary as well, I will encourage patients to make a nutrition consultation so that I have time to go deeper into educating patients on both Western holistic approaches to nutrition, as well as individualized Eastern approaches they can incorporate as well.

Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through your skin, to various depths and at strategic points , known as “acupoints”. During your first session, we will complete your initial consultation, in which I will ask you many detailed questions related to your health and lifestyle, and you will have the chance to have any questions or concerns answered. Only single-use, pre-sterilized, packaged needles are used. &nbsp; Upon insertion, you may feel a brief, pinching sensation, and once the acupuncture needles are in you might feel sensations such as tingling, pressure, flowing currents, warmth, or coolness. Despite how this sounds, these are usually very relaxing sensations, and in fact, most first time patients who are nervous are pleasantly surprised by how little they feel! &nbsp;Once the needles are all inserted, you will then rest for anywhere from 15-40 minutes with soft music playing. Many patients fall asleep, and almost everyone reports feelings of unusual calm, deep relaxation,or even euphoria, after their acupuncture treatments.
