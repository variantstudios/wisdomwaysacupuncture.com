# Services Offered

### Acupuncture & Customized Chinese Herbs

My patients generally receive treatment that includes a combination of Acupuncture and customized Chinese herbal formulas. Due to the nature of conditions I treat, rather than being “supplemental”, the herbs are a central and integral part of the treatment process.

The goal is to get you the best results in the shortest amount of time, and while acupuncture or herbs can be used individually, the combination of the two has proven to be the best, and fastest, route to recovery.

Click the navigation tabs at the top to find out more about each of these treatments as well as how I work with them.

### Nutritional Guidance

In addition to Acupuncture and herbs, if nutritional guidance/changes will help as well, I’ll encourage you to make a nutrition consultation so that I have time to go deeper into educating you on both Western holistic approaches to nutrition, as well as individualized Eastern approaches you can incorporate as well.

While I’m not a nutritionist, these recommendations are usually enough to help women reach their goals. In some cases I might I refer out to others who can run us lab tests and/or provide more in-depth or intuitive eating counseling.
