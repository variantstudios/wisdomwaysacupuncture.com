  - testimonial_html: "<p>Before I started acupuncture, I was anxious and on edge all the time, and having two panic attacks almost every week. Then, I'd have to deal with the stomach cramping and bowel problems for days after. Almost immediately with the acupuncture my panic attacks decreased by about half, and I started feeling calmer and less high strung. I used to not be able to settle down, and would irritate everyone around me with my constant fidgeting. My bowels also got much more normal and I wouldn’t have the constipation and diarrhea. I started decreasing my treatments once my panic attacks went away completely, and even though sometimes I feel like I'll get one if I have a major project coming up, now I’m able to calm myself down on my own, or I just schedule a treatment the week I know I'll be under more stress, and it takes care of it. I love my acupuncture!</p>"

  - testimonial_html: "<p>My husband and I had been trying for about 3 years to get pregnant, 2 of those just by not trying to NOT get pregnant, but the last year with much stressful dedication. I also had a lot of anxiety. We were headed towards looking at IVF treatment but due to the costs and stress associated with the procedure, we thought we’d try Chinese medicine first. I started acupuncture and within 3 cycles we were pregnant! The added bonus was that I was so much more calm from the treatment. We’re now shooting for number two, and will be back to acupuncture if we have troubles again!</p>"
