      <p>Before I started acupuncture, I was anxious and on edge all the time,
      and having two panic attacks almost every week. Then, I'd have to deal
      with the stomach cramping and bowel problems for days after. Almost
      immediately with the acupuncture my panic attacks decreased by about half,
      and I started feeling calmer and less high strung. I used to not be able
      to settle down, and would irritate everyone around me with my constant
      fidgeting. My bowels also got much more normal and I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      the constipation and diarrhea. I started decreasing my treatments once my
      panic attacks went away completely, and even though sometimes I feel like
      I'll get one if I have a major project coming up, now I&rsquo;m able to
      calm myself down on my own, or I just schedule a treatment the week I know
      I'll be under more stress, and it takes care of it. I love my
      acupuncture!</p>

      <p>My husband and I had been trying for about 3 years to get pregnant, 2
      of those just by not trying to NOT get pregnant, but the last year with
      much stressful dedication. I also had a lot of anxiety. We were headed
      towards looking at IVF treatment but due to the costs and stress
      associated with the procedure, we thought we&rsquo;d try Chinese medicine
      first. I started acupuncture and within 3 cycles we were pregnant! The
      added bonus was that I was so much more calm from the treatment.
      We&rsquo;re now shooting for number two, and will be back to acupuncture
      if we have troubles again!</p>

      <p>My IBS got really bad last year after a really hard and stressful time.
      I started getting acupuncture, and even after the first treatment for the
      first time in months I didn&rsquo;t have diarrhea.&nbsp; After a few weeks
      of getting treatment the results started lasting longer and now I
      don&rsquo;t really feel like I even&nbsp; have IBS.</p>

      <p>Thank you, Inger, for your willingness to take the time to look at all
      the different aspects involved with my healing. I&rsquo;ve never had a
      health care provider spend so much time with me, and really considering
      not just my symptoms, but foods, my stress levels, the way I&rsquo;m
      living my life, the amount of stress I let myself live in, etc.
      You&rsquo;ve helped me see health in a bigger picture, and I&rsquo;m
      better for it. Thank you!</p>

      <p>I started acupuncture after getting diagnosed with lupus.&nbsp; I
      absolutely refused to go on the steroids that they wanted to give me, and
      am so grateful to have found Inger instead.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m managing my
      symptoms completely with acupuncture and nutrition, and for the most part,
      I feel almost like I did before getting sick now. Inger was the only
      health care person on my &ldquo;team&rdquo; to even mention the nutrition
      and food connections with auto-immunity, but her advise in this realm has
      helped me immensely.</p>

      <p>I was literally afraid I was dying when I went to see Inger for
      acupuncture. I had so many weird symptoms and no doctors could explain
      them. All my tests were turning out normal, and while each one was relief,
      as time went on and I just started feeling worse, it almost became more
      frustrating that everything was turning out &ldquo;fine&rdquo;. I was
      &ldquo;fine&rdquo;. But I wasn&rsquo;t fine. I felt crappy ALL THE TIME.
      At my first acupuncture treatment, after listening to my long list of
      weird, hard to explain symptoms, Inger didn&rsquo;t seem surprised at all
      to hear them all. When she was even able to guess some of my other weird
      symptoms, and seemed to know exactly what they were related to, I felt my
      body relax for the first time in months. Somehow, from an energetic
      perspective, she was able to explain how it all tied together, and when
      she explained the cause of it all I could just relate to everything she
      was saying. She was using weird terms I&rsquo;d never heard of, but
      somehow, it made sense. And, she seemed completely confident that it would
      resolve, knew exactly what we needed to do to get there, and we came up
      with a plan.&nbsp; It was like she saw this stuff everyday. Sure enough,
      even after the first treatment, my head was just clearer. It was like a
      fog was lifted and I could think again. My energy stabilized. And as the
      weeks progressed, one by one my symptoms just disappeared. I&rsquo;m not
      perfect yet. I still have some things we&rsquo;re working on, but even
      those are night and day different from when I started. When my doctors
      tell me it must all be a coincidence, because acupuncture isn&rsquo;t
      &ldquo;proven&rdquo;, I just chuckle inside.</p>
