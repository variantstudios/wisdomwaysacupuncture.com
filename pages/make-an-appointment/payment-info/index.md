# Payment Info

At your initial appointment, during your consultation I'll go over your diagnosis and treatment options with you, and together we will come up with a treatment plan that best fits your needs.

There are three types of payment options, each listed below.

### Self-Pay (non insurance) Patients:

**Pay-As-You-Go:** These treatments are charged at the full treatment price and are due at each treatment

**Packages:** Because acupuncture works over a series of treatments, I offer discounted treatment package rates. The more serious or long-term your condition – and therefore usually the more treatments you need – the higher the package discount will be. &nbsp;

Package discounts are as follows:

* ~ 5% off a 5 Treatment package
* ~ 10% off a 10 Treatment package
* ~ 15% off a 25 Treatment package
* ~ 20% off a 50 Treatment package

All payments for packages are due at time of first treatment to receive the discounted rates.

Please call or email to find out the costs for individual treatments and treatment packages. &nbsp;(970) 227-3077

### Insurance Patients:

Your fees are based on your personal contracted rate with your insurance company.

We are happy to bill your insurance company for you – if you would like your insurance billed at your first visit, you simply need to print out the [Acupuncture Insurance Verification and Financial Agreement](/assets/pdf/INSURANCE VERIFICATION &amp; FINANCIAL AGREEMENT.2018.pdf){: target="_blank"}, then call your insurance to get the answers to the questions on the form so you can arrive with it fully completed at your first visit, your coverage verified and understanding what it includes.

**IT IS THE PATIENT’S RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR INSURANCE DOES AND DOES NOT COVER BEFORE THEIR VISIT.** While we can't guarantee that this form with cover all the various exclusions insurance companies may have, filing out this form does help prevent unexpected surprises or payments due at time of service.

If you do not arrive with your insurance coverage verified and the form completed, we will simply charge the out-of-pocket rate until the time when your coverage can be verified.

We are currently in network with Cigna, United, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, and Coventry.

Any required Co-pay is due at time of service.

Medicare/Medicaid currently do **NOT** cover acupuncture services.
