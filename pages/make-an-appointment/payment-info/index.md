# Payment Info

There are a variety of treatment plans and packages to fit your needs, and in the end your wellness goals will decide which plan is right for you.

Are your goals to:

* simply alleviate symptoms?
* move past “coping” or symptom-alleviation and into high levels of wellness and thriving?

Would you like nutritional guidance and individualized food recommendations as well, based on both your western & Chinese medicine diagnosis? &nbsp;

Either way, Chinese Medicine can take you where you want to go.

At your initial treatment, I will go over your diagnosis and options with you, and together we will come up with a treatment plan that best fits your needs.

### Self-Pay (non insurance) Patients:

**Pay-As-You-Go:** These treatments are charged at the full treatment price and are due at each treatment

**Packages:** Because acupuncture works over a series of treatments, I offer discounted treatment package rates. The more serious or long-term your condition – and therefore usually the more treatments you need – the higher the package discount will be. &nbsp;

Package discounts are as follows:

* ~ 5% off a 5 Treatment package
* ~ 10% off a 10 Treatment package
* ~ 15% off a 25 Treatment package
* ~ 20% off a 50 Treatment package

All payments for packages are due at time of first treatment to receive the discounted rates.

Please call or email to find out the costs for individual treatments and treatment packages. &nbsp;(970) 227-3077

### Insurance Patients:

We are happy to bill your insurance company for you! &nbsp;If you would like your insurance billed, you simply need to print out the following Acupuncture Insurance Verification and Financial Agreement , then call your insurance to get the answers to the questions on the form so you can arrive with it fully completed at your first visit, your coverage verified and understanding what it includes.

**IT IS THE PATIENT’S RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR INSURANCE DOES AND DOES NOT COVER BEFORE THEIR VISIT.** While we can't guarantee that this form with cover all the various exclusions insurance companies may have, filing out this form does help prevent unexpected surprises or payments due at time of service.

If you do not arrive with your insurance coverage verified and the form completed, we will simply charge the out-of-pocket rate until the time when your coverage can be verified.

We are currently in network with Cigna, United, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, and Coventry.

Any required Co-pay is due at time of service.

Medicare/Medicaid currently do **NOT** cover acupuncture services.
