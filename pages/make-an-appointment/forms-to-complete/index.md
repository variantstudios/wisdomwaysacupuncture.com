# Wisdom Ways Forms to Complete

Please print and complete ALL of the relevant\* forms in the links below, and bring them to your first acupuncture visit. If you do not have a printer or need to fill them out once you arrive, please email or call to let us know you will be arriving 30-40 minutes early to complete the forms, and we will have them waiting and ready for you when you arrive.

It often takes people up to 30 minutes to complete all forms, so we recommend not waiting until the last minute!

**FERTILITY PATIENTS:&nbsp;**&nbsp;Please note that you have an extra form to complete, outlining your fertility history

I**NSURANCE PATIENTS:&nbsp;**PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU WISH US TO BILL INSURANCE, YOU MUST ARRIVE WITH THE LAST FORM COMPLETED, SO THAT YOUR INSURANCE HAS BEEN VERIFIED BEFORE YOUR VISIT. OTHERWISE WE WILL JUST ASSESS THE SELF-PAY RATE UNTIL THE TIME AT WHICH YOUR INSURANCE HAS BEEN VERIFIED. We are happy to bill your insurance for you, but we need your help in order to help you! To avoid any surprise charges at your first visit, please come prepared with this form completed.&nbsp;
