NEW PATIENTS: before your appointment, please follow the “Forms to Complete” tab at the top to access and print the forms you will need to bring in to your first visit. If you cannot print these forms, please come to your acupuncture appointment 1/2 hr early to complete forms. Thank You!

### Insurance Patients

It is your responsibility to verify insurance benefits before your arrival. If you would like your insurance billed, you MUST arrive at your first appointment with this Insurance Verification and Financial Agreement completed. If you do not arrive with this form completed, we will simply charge the out-of-pocket rate for your treatments until the time at which your insurance has been verified.

### Cancellation Policy

* Cancellations and/or no-shows must be made at least 24 hours in advance. Any late-cancel or no-show will be charged 100% of the treatment fee.
* If you no-show or late cancel on your initial consultation, pre-payment will be required before being able to reschedule this appointment.
* Patients receiving discounted treatments for any reason will be charged the full treatment fee for missed appointments.
