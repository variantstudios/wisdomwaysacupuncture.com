### New Patients

Before your appointment, please follow the “[Forms to Complete](/make-an-appointment/forms-to-complete/)” page to access and print the forms you will need to bring in to your first visit. If you cannot print these forms, please come to your acupuncture appointment 1/2 hr early to complete forms. Thank You!

### Insurance Patients

It is your responsibility to verify insurance benefits before your arrival. If you would like your insurance billed, you MUST arrive at your first appointment with this [Insurance Verification and Financial Agreement](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/INSURANCE-VERIFICATION-2015.docx){: target="_blank"} completed. If you do not arrive with this form completed, we will simply charge the out-of-pocket rate for your treatments until the time at which your insurance has been verified.

### Cancellation Policy

* Cancellations and/or no-shows must be made at least 24 hours in advance. Any late-cancel or no-show will be charged 100% of the treatment fee.
* If you no-show or late cancel on your initial consultation, pre-payment will be required before being able to reschedule this appointment.
* Patients receiving discounted treatments for any reason will be charged the full treatment fee for missed appointments.
