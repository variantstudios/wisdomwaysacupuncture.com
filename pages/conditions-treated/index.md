# Acupuncture Specialties: Women’s Health & Chronic Illness

If you're suffering from chronic internal medical issues or women's health problems, then you're in the right place!

I’ve chosen to focus my practice and training for many years now, on specific health issues that often involve multi-system problems — often related to hormonal imbalances and/or stress and overwork/fatigue.

As I've honed in on working with only certain conditions, I've been able to greatly increase my success in treating them.

For more details on each area of specialty, please scroll over the "Conditions Treated" tabs above to find your condition.

### Acupuncture treats “Patterns of Imbalance” and all related symptoms, not individual symptoms

While acupuncture is a holistic form of treatment – meaning that the entire body and all its symptoms are treated as a whole rather than as separate problems – it can still be confusing to understand how we can really specialize in such varying ailments.

The reason why we can “specialize” in many different types of illness, is because symptoms tend to come not individually, but along with many others. &nbsp;You have probably experienced that yourself—your migraines tend to be worse the same months your PMS is really bad. Your depression/anxiety acts up right when your IBS is at its worst. &nbsp;Your fibromyalgia worsens when you are extra fatigued. If you were seeing western specialists, you would go to a different specialist for each one of these issues. But because acupuncturists don’t treat based on symptoms, and rather on patterns of symptoms which make up your diagnosis of imbalance, we treat all the things associated with an imbalance at the same time.

### Conditions for which I refer out:

With that said, there are certain conditions that I feel are better treated by others who have specific advanced training in those ailments and stay on top of all the latest western/complementary treatments (ex: injuries/most orthopedic problems, cancer, IVF, addiction, & others); and I refer out in these cases.

* Injury/Sports Medicine
* Most Orthopedic issues/pain (i.e. joint, muscle, or tendon pain/problems)
* Neurological Issues including neuropathy and stroke/post stroke
* Addiction
* Cancer
* Pediatrics
* Men’s health
* Some skin issues
* Late stage pregnancy issues and labor/delivery prep, as well as women currently using IVF/ART

This list is not exhaustive and if we don’t feel we’re the best clinic to help you, we will give you the names of other acupuncturists in the area who would be more likely to give you better care for your condition than we can. Our goal is that you work with a clinic who can help you the most, and if we don’t think that’s us, we’ll tell you!
