# Acupuncture Specialties: Women’s Health & Chronic Illness

If you're suffering from chronic symptoms or women's health problems, then you're in the right place! If you're worried you'll never feel better because you've "tried everything" or your case is particularly complex, then you're among great company with many of our patients.

Rather than treating everything that presents itself to me, I’ve chosen to hone my skills by working with only specific health issues.&nbsp; By focusing intently on learning as much as I can about these medical issues, I've been able to have breakthroughs with even the toughest cases. For more details on each area of specialty, please scroll over the "Conditions Treated" tabs above to find your condition.

The issues I work on often involve multi-system problems — commonly related to hormonal imbalances and/or stress and overwork/fatigue. While not always complex, they can usually be quite a puzzle and I love trying to crack the code!

By cracking the code we've discovered the underlying connection between all your symptoms, and that's how many different problems can be treated all at once.

### Conditions for which I refer out:

While acupuncture is a holistic form of treatment – meaning that the entire body and all its symptoms are treated as a whole rather than as separate problems – there are certain conditions that I feel are better treated by others who have specific advanced training in those ailments and stay on top of all the latest western/complementary treatments; and I refer out in these cases.

* Injury/Sports Medicine
* Most Orthopedic pain (i.e. joint, muscle, structural, or tendon problems)
* Neurological issues including neuropathy and stroke/post stroke
* Addiction
* Current Cancer
* Pediatrics
* Men’s health
* Some skin issues
* Late stage pregnancy problems and labor/delivery prep, as well as women currently using IVF/ART

This list is not exhaustive and if we don’t feel we’re the best clinic to help you, we will give you the names of other acupuncturists in the area who would be more likely to give you better care for your condition than we can. Our goal is that you work with a clinic who can help you the most, and if we don’t think that’s us, we’ll tell you!
