# Wisdom Teeth

Wisdom teeth or third molars, are the last teeth to normally develop in the adult mouth.  Often wisdom teeth are angled and fail to erupt into a functional position.  Wisdom teeth also interfere with the eruption and position of other permanent teeth.  It is not uncommon for there to be limited space for third molars to erupt, so if they are only partially exposed, brushing and keeping those areas clean can be quite difficult leading to higher incidences of decay and soft tissue infections.

Because of the common problems associated with wisdom teeth, they are often removed.  If removed during a person's teenage years, the roots are usually not fully developed which decreases the risks that are associated with removal later in life.

Extraction of wisdom teeth may not be necessary for everyone, and there are individuals that we all know who still have their wisdom teeth.  A thorough consultation with your dentist, orthodontist, or our office can be very helpful in evaluating your individual need for extraction or observation of your third molars.
