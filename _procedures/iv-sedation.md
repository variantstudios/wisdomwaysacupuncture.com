# IV Sedation

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are specially trained to provide IV sedation in their offices, depending on the nature of the surgical procedure IV sedation can provide for a safe, comfortable alternative to local anesthetic while undergoing oral surgery procedures. 
Certainly there are procedures that can be completed with local anesthetic, however many patients choose, or are referred to an oral surgeon specifically to receive IV sedation to reduce anxiety that is often associated with oral surgery.

If you have questions about the types of anesthesia that are available, and to discuss which might be best for you, schedule a consultation.  Discussing and understanding the surgical procedure and how your overall health might influence having IV sedation can often help in feeling more comfortable with your choice.
