###### Making healthy food choices in the midst of busy, over-filled lives can be a challenge, even for someone like me who’s a complete foodie and loves cooking from scratch. If we can make eating healthy FUN and unintimidating, then we’re more likely to make those better choices.

###### These blogs cover topics such as: paleo benefits, struggles, and recipes; local eating, food-as medicine, seasonal eating, Chinese medicine nutrition principles, my own food challenges and triumphs, and just general inspiration for great eating!
