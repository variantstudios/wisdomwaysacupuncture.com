###### I've been told often that I have a very unique style of practicing acupuncture. I blend my passion for educating patients with my personal background of meditation and emotional healing, as well as my science background from my pre-med studies at University. I bring in my love of writing, food, and nutrition; but above everything else my belief that if I can empower patients with knowledge and tools to keep them healthy and balanced, they'll need my help much less and live lives filled with vibrancy.

###### These blogs help illustrate my style of practice, however since all my blogs are a reflection of my approach to the medicine, check out more topics to learn about the 5 Elements, clinical success stories, and more!
