We&#8217;ve arrived!  The sun is bright!  The days last seemingly into the night and a playful feeling fills the air.

Most of us long all year for summer, and finally, finally, it is here.  We are energized, invigorated, and connections and fun with loved ones is the norm.

**What is it about this season of Fire that makes everything feel a bit easier, a bit more filled with hope?  Let&#8217;s explore this element so we can discover its wisdom, and stay balanced during this season of sometimes scattered energies.**

If you read my [articles in the Spring](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2018/05/15/ready-set-wood-season-what-acupuncture-theory-has-to-say-about-spring/), you&#8217;ll remember the [Wood season](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2018/05/10/the-wood-element-of-acupuncture-theory/) was about direction and goals, about creating our vision and hopes for the future. **The Fire season which follows then, finds us standing in those hopes and dreams fulfilled.** Nature, which reflects these inner rhythms, is in perfect display of this pattern of fruition.  Flowers bloom at their fullest, trees bear their fruit and the garden grows wildly towards to sun.  We have completed the work of the spring&#8211;the laying down of the seed and the planning and planting, and **all that is left now is to sit and allow the sun to bring all towards ripeness.** 

**The specific qualities of Fire are communion, connection, love, and joy**.  Lovely!  These are all aspects of the natural expression of Qi at its highest point of the year, and those which we want to nurture during the summer to stay balanced.  When the Qi is at its peak, like the sun high in the sky, the warmth and love that fill us during this season warm us also when the days become shorter and our energies are directing inward.  **A healthy Fire element keeps grieving and sorrow in check, and provides for us the bonding and play that is vital for a thriving life.** **As the Fire element is related to the heart, it becomes easy to understand how important a heart connection is during this time of year&#8211;w****e must feel the joy of unity with others, as there is no greater expression of what it is to be human.  In this regard, intimacy is not a luxury, but an essential experience which must be in place to experience the wholeness of BE-ing.** 

**How does Fire express when imbalanced then, and what can you do to resolve this?** We can break it up into excess and deficiency, and give examples of typical issues related to both:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Deficiency types have a hard time letting loose and knowing how to be playful, and they may take life too seriously, </strong>rarely bringing laughter into their days and relationships.  They may isolate, unsure of how to create that heart connection with others.  <strong>Physically, they may lack internal warmth and their internal processes can slow down and function poorly.</strong> Their circulation will be sluggish and they can have heart and/or vascular problems.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Excess types may charmingly fall madly and maniacally in love with every person they date, yet lose interest once the flames of novelty burn out </strong>and create not only chaos and disorder in their own life, but a path of destruction with many &#8220;burnt&#8221; souls behind them.  <strong>Physically they may be very high strung and have a hard time slowing down, and may have too much heat which manifests as excessive thirst, dryness, high blood pressure, and red face and skin, along with many other symptoms. </strong>
</p>

### **To balance the Fire element:**

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    Because <strong>the fire element is so much about connection and understanding, make a point this season of focusing on <em>understanding</em> and really <em>listening</em> to those around you,</strong> before overriding their comments with your own.  Your connections this summer will be much more fulfilling.
  </li>
</ul>

**_Excess Fire types:_**

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <strong>For those falling in love constantly, take a break from romantic relationship for the summer,</strong> and feed your Fire by connecting with loved ones instead.  Try cultivating a love with yourself for just this season, and see what happens!
  </li>
</ul>

**_Deficient Fire types:_** 

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <strong>If you have a hard time connecting, push yourself to socialize more.  It is especially important during this season!</strong> If you seriously isolate and are unable to maintain even friendships, you may need the support of a therapist.  But take heart, because the energies of the entire universe are supporting you this season to open your heart to trust and love again!
  </li>
</ul>

    <strong>Foods for Summer:</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211;<strong>Your</strong> <strong>diet should reflect the bounty and variety of vegetables that are now in season</strong>.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211; <strong>More cooling foods can be eaten safely at this time of year than any other</strong>: Salads, melons, sprouts, fruits, cucumbers, and tofu. But even on hot days, <strong>avoid extremely cold foods and drinks (like iced liquids), as cold causes contraction and hampers digestion</strong>.  To prevent this, make slightly cooling choices. Best are apples, watermelons, lemons and limes.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211;<strong>While spicy foods temporarily increase warmth, they then transport your heat to the exterior for dispersal. </strong><strong>In the warmest of weather, very hot-spicy foods are appropriate, but take care</strong>, as too much dispersal of heat can lead to weakness or loss of yang (heat), which then affects your body&#8217;s ability to stay warm in the winter.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong><em>You&#8217;ve waited all year for this time, so celebrate your heart Fire, as this warmth will bring Joy to your life for the entire year ahead. </em></strong>
