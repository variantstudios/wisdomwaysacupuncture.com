One of the hardest things for us to figure out when my partner first got diagnosed with an auto-immune condition, was what to do for breakfast.

Eggs had been our mainstay. Veggie scrambles and veggie frittatas made up the bulk of our breakfast food. But on the AutoImmune Protocol (AIP) eggs are out.  

I knew it needed to feel like comfort food, since neither of us wanted to get up and have leftovers or other food that’s normally considered lunch or dinner fare.

### The solution for us was our Creamy Chicken Veggie Bisque

Several years in and we’re still enjoying this almost every morning. We whip up a huge vat of this once/week, and freeze big parts of it to take out and defrost as the week progresses.

Since he’s doing fabulous, living with no sign of the disease whatsoever, we long ago backed down to just plain paleo, so sometimes if we’re out of bisque we’ll have a veggie scramble again. But for the most part, even though we CAN eat eggs again, this bisque is so yummy, savory, satisfying, and creamy, as well as easy to reheat in the mornings; that we often actually prefer it now.

Also, it gets veggies into your body first thing in the morning without you even trying!

### Here’s the basic recipe.

Don’t get stuck on the details. These just happen to be the ingredients we use but you can throw in any veggies you happen to have lying around.

We use a GINORMOUS pot for this. You don’t need to make yours as big as ours, but if you’re using a whole chicken and making soup for the whole week, you may want to invest in a 12 quart pot like ours.

##### Ingredients:

* Duck fat, avocado oil, or whatever other healthy fat you have that is OK to heat at high temps
* Whole organic and pastured chicken
* Yellow onion/s
* Carrots
* Celery
* Daikon radish
* Homemade chicken or lamb bone broth
* Bouillon cubes (without a bunch of crap/chemicals in them!)
* Salt
* Pepper
* Raw ginger nub
* Garlic
* Bay leaves

##### Directions:

1) Roughly chop all veggies. They’ll be getting pureed anyway so they don’t need to be perfect

2) Saute onion, carrots, celery, and ginger until onion goes clear and veggies are “sweating”. Then add garlic and cook for another minute or so

3) Put rinsed chicken into pot (make sure to check for innards, which are often stuffed inside in a little bag)

4) Pour the daikon radish over everything

5) Pour in just enough broth to cover everything

6) Add bay leaves, bouillon cubes and salt and pepper to taste

7) Bring to a boil then turn down and set a timer for about 35 minutes. (less if you’re just using separate cuts of chicken, which will cook faster)

8) Get a large set of tongs and CAREFULLY remove the whole chicken and put it on a plate to cool. Once cool enough to touch, take all meat off the carcass and put it back in the pot. 

9) Once the soup has cooled enough to not be as dangerous should splatters happen, use your immersion blender to puree the soup into a bisque. If you don’t have an immersion blender, well, first piece of advice is you get one. J Second piece of advice is use a blender and add the soup in batches into the blender and keep doing that until it’s all blended.

10) Eat and enjoy!!!
