## <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Using Acupuncture for pain as a substitute for drugs like morphine</strong></span>

**A study recently released by UCSF school of medicine showed that acupuncture is as effective as morphine for treating pain. That means that patients can feel confident that using acupuncture for pain will likely be a safe, drug-free way to manage their pain.
  
** 

**Another [study recently published in JAMA](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1357513 "acupuncture proven effective for pain"), formerly Archives of Internal Medicine and a widely respected peer reviewed medical journal, showed that acupuncture is an effective medicine for pain management.** It compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture in 17,922 patients, and as quoted from their website, &#8220;Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain and is therefore a reasonable referral option. Significant differences between true and sham acupuncture indicate that acupuncture is more than a placebo.&#8221;

While this may be news to some, and just the confidence-inspiring study that skeptics may need to follow through on recommendations they&#8217;ve been getting from doctors and friends alike, I will repeat what those of us who work in this field have been saying for years: we already knew that. :-)

I am no longer taking new patients for sports injuries and other orthopedic pain issues, but work daily with pain caused by internal medical issues, such as fibromyalgia, headaches, pain from auto-immune disorders causing general and systemic inflammation, and other conditions such as Lyme disease.  While many of these types of pains occur in the muscles, internally generated pain (rather than strictly musculoskeletal) requires complex understandings of the imbalances that are occurring inside the body and causing the pain, along with all the other symptoms that patients with these disorders often experience, such as fatigue, weak immunity, brain fog, vague or changing nervous system symptoms, and many more.

If you are dealing with any kind of n0n-sports or traumatic related pain, I would love to see you and help you recover from these imbalances.  And if strict musculoskeletal pain is your issue, such as pulled muscles, herniated disks, torn ligaments, etc. then there are excellent acupuncturists in town that I can refer you to who have post graduate training in orthopedic acupuncture and who specialize in just your type of issue. Either way, you likely don&#8217;t need to deal with the pain you are living with, and acupuncture is here to help!
