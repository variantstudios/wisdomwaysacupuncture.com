People love hating beets.

I do admit, they can go either way…if not cooked right, they have a taste that can be a little...well, bad. But I just tried a new recipe this week that has me fanatical over this humble red root.

Because beets are so wonderful for nourishing your “liver blood”, and according to acupuncture and Chinese medicine theory we are in [Wood season](/2011/03/21/its-wood-season-tips-for-keeping-your-liver-happy-this-spring/) which relates to the liver, this is a perfect time to get down as many of these little spherical friends as possible.

### Women can especially benefit from eating beets

Acupuncturists believe it is especially important for women to boost their blood, as we lose blood every month and through it, much qi and nourishment. But we can all benefit from nourishing our liver right now, so I hope you all, yes even you beet haters (I know who you are!), will take a stab at this recipe this spring.

### Common symptoms of liver imbalance are:

* Blurry vision and dry eyes
* vertigo and dizzyness
* dull complexion
* night blindness
* numbness of extremities
* tremors, spasticity, muscle cramps
* mentrual disorders
* insomnia
* anxiety.

But remember, we don’t actually have to have symptoms in order to be “blood deficient”.&nbsp;

The whole magic of Chinese Medicine and eating for balance is in doing and eating things that constantly nourish different aspects of our health, so that we don’t end up with symptoms later due to imbalances that are occurring under our radar now.
