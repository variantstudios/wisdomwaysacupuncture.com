Welcome to [Summer, the Fire season](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2011/06/15/out-of-the-wood-and-into-the-fire-tips-for-keeping-your-fire-element-balanced-this-summer/), and my latest video in my 5 Elements series!Â  This one focuses on the [Fire element](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2017/05/23/into-the-fire-we-go-more-tips-from-an-acupuncturist-for-staying-balanced-in-summer/), and while there&#8217;s way too much to say about each element to fit into a short helpful video, I cover three vital aspects and functions of the Fire energy, and leave you with some tips you can follow if after watching the video, you think your [Fire Element could use some nurturing](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2014/08/15/fire-element-robin-williams-suicidedepression/).

Enjoy!
