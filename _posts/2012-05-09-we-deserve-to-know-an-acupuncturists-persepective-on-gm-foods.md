  <img src="https://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs085/1102844965003/img/109.jpg" alt="No GMO" width="160" height="199" align="left" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" />I usually don&#8217;t send out even quasi-political emails to my patients, because I feel in most cases it&#8217;s not appropriate.  However, <strong>the situation that is before us plays such a huge role in the issue of our health and our children&#8217;s health <em>forever into the future</em></strong> that I couldn&#8217;t NOT alert you all to this, and share info on how you can make a difference.
</p>

**The issue before us is the ongoing problem with Genetically Modified (GM) foods.** (Or, GMO) **Many countries in Europe have strictly banned them from entering, due to the irrefutable scientific evidence proving their harm to our health.  Some states in the US are pushing legislation that would require labeling of GM foods&#8211;they&#8217;re not even asking for banning, they simply want them labeled.** But the biotech companies that are producing them (Monsanto being the biggest <span style="color: #808080;">-and update as of 2018, now bought by Bayer so nicknamed Monsanto-Bayer </span>) are so threatened by labeling &#8212; because they know people don&#8217;t want them &#8212; that their lobbyists are effectively squashing any such bill for labeling. **_Just this week, a Connecticut bill was squashed that would allow voters to vote on mandatory labeling.  With 90% of Connecticut in favor of GM labeling, on the eve of this historic vote the governor killed the bill, after threats of the state being sued by the biotech industry._** California is also trying to bringing such a bill to the vote, and being the 8th largest economy in the world, if California succeeds, that will pave the way for the rest of the country to have fair labeling.  **You deserve the right to know what you&#8217;re eating, and to NOT eat GM foods if you don&#8217;t want to.**

** <span style="color: #808000;">Why are people so opposed to GM foods&#8230;what&#8217;s the big deal?:</span>**

  <strong>New &#8220;foods&#8221; come on the market every day that are harmful to our health, but this level of danger has never before been seen in history.  <em>What makes this unprecedented problem so huge, is that because the DNA of the seeds of these foods has been genetically altered, there is no turning back once these seeds get out and mix with normal crops.</em></strong> Research is showing that these foods are highly toxic&#8230;sometimes even lethal, and billions of years of crop diversity and access to healthful foods is at stake, forever.
</div>

<span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Something smells rotten&#8230;scandals and scientist discrediting<br /> </strong></span>

**In the UK, the government asked one of its leading scientists, Albert Putsdai, to study the safety of GMOs. He found, that after 3 months of feeding GMO potatoes to laboratory animals, their brains shrank, their pancreases expanded, and their immunity collapsed.** As a reward for Putsdai&#8217;s unfavorable findings and because of the government&#8217;s ties to the biotech industry, they fired him from his prestigious University position and his findings were never published.  **In the US, when a study showed that GMO tomatoes caused stomach lesions in lab animals, the findings were hidden by <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-complete-history-of-monsanto-the-worlds-most-evil-corporation/5387964" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monsanto</a>, who produces 85% of the GM foods across the globe.**

Because Monsanto is doing their best to own as much of the seeds in the world as possible  by <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001dBFT-wSwqAE2e2RI2R6VrE8uVSuDzvp7Z4Cu_PTrkiQYI97t7Lr9MwcK4Lc-XNI6Vc8dRhOjFzauYZWVNx_Nb2tvFdEeLxBtJGPSzJExfsF4fANM3Jd0lPI2ZN2LkgVZHPikLDZv4Rw=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying out small seed companies and then providing only their GM seeds to those market lines</a>, if things continue as they are, it is not an &#8220;if&#8221; there comes a day when all our food is GM and potentially inedible and toxic, but &#8220;when&#8221;.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>If they are so bad, our USDA and FDA would be banning them, right?:</strong>
</p>

### 

### <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Corruption in our Gov&#8217;t Agencies tied to Biotech</strong></span>

<div>
  <strong>Not when the top officials in both agencies are the same people who cycle through top executive or legal positions within the biotech industry.  Just some examples:<br /> </strong></p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Tom Vilsack, </strong><strong>Secretary of Agriculture</strong><strong>: a leading advocate for Monsanto</strong>: Our own leader of the USDA, as Iowa state governor originated a bill that effectively blocked local communities from regulating where genetically engineered crops would be grown; additionally, Vilsack was the founder and former chair of the Governor&#8217;s Biotechnology Partnership, and was named Governor of the Year by the <a>Biotechnology Industry Organization</a>, an industry <a>lobbying</a> group.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

  * **<a>Michael Taylor, Senior Adviser to the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner on Food Safety</a>: former Monsanto lobbyist**

  * **<a>Roger Beachy, Director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture</a>: long time Monsanto collaborator** : Heads an institute which was established by Monsanto and academic partners with a $70-million pledge from the corporation. It&#8217;s effectively a Monsanto front.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>But I&#8217;ve heard that GM foods are identical to their non-GMO counterparts</strong>?</span>
</p>

Of course you have&#8230;that&#8217;s because any evidence that proves otherwise is swept under the rug and prohibited from being published in journals. Monsanto has irrefutably hidden the study results that show how toxic the GM foods are, but if you look at their reports that made it to Japan before they were covered up, you see right there in their own documents.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>What can I do about this now?</strong></span>
</p>

  * Well, the best thing is to do what I&#8217;m doing&#8230;I&#8217;m on the mailing list of consumer&#8217;s organizations that are working with this issue.  They alert us to things like what just happened this week in Connecticut.  Connecticut needs to know that they&#8217;ve got our support! Many times, all it takes is the click of a petition and you&#8217;ve let your legislators not only know where you stand on this issue, but that you&#8217;re aware and you&#8217;re watching.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Get onto the <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001dBFT-wSwqAE2e2RI2R6VrE8uVSuDzvp7Z4Cu_PTrkiQYI97t7Lr9MwcK4Lc-XNI6Vc8dRhOjFzbsv37XgmVq8Fmw-ueaw9jA92noveOpdoI6yIVhSU2Z-HSC4QnvEWTF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute for Responsible Technology</a>&#8216;s website and sing up for their newsletter.
</p>

  * Talk to the managers at your local grocery stores, whether they be health food stores or otherwise.  Tell them you are considering not shopping there if they will not take a stand on prohibiting GM foods from being sold in their stores.  Many health food stores have already publicly declared themselves non GM stores.

  * Get your friends together, grab some popcorn, and watch <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001dBFT-wSwqAE2e2RI2R6VrE8uVSuDzvp7Z4Cu_PTrkiQYI97t7Lr9MwcK4Lc-XNI6Vc8dRhOjFzYkmidQtRveVFHzRrZAr_7TVHhfFpvxbjQimF-WQgMrluhFjQZRUMGO_AXNLpeqdKfpTp5XWT_ThRYWoPr_sAhJOj5_jjMAx2c=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The World According to Monsanto.</a>

  * Shop and eat as local as possible!  Frequenting your organic farmers at your local farmers market is a guaranteed way to avoid GM foods and support the sustainability and feasibility of safe, regional foods.

**Now as I said, I don&#8217;t like to send out emails that can be perceived as political, because I want my office to be a comfortable place for everyone, regardless of political persuasion.  However, health is EXTREMELY political because of the money involved.  And we _all_ need to eat, regardless of which side of the spectrum we fall on.** 

<p style="text-align: center;">
  I do hope that more and more of us will learn about this issue, so that when the day comes, and hopefully soon, that we in Colorado get to vote for GM labeling, we will know where we stand.
