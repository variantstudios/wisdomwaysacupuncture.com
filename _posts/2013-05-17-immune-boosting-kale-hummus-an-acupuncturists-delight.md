    As an acupuncturist, I'm somewhat fanatical about the benefits of dark leafy
    greens, and particularly kale, for balancing your liver.  But it's always a
    challenge to eat enough as we'd like.  Here's an unusual way to squeeze more
    kale into your diet, which according to acupuncture theory, will help keep
    you balanced as we progress through spring.

##### (post update: This was written before I went paleo…you can still make it by just subbing steamed cauliflower for the beans!)

You’ve all had hummus, right? &nbsp; Well as an acupuncturist who’s somewhat fanatical about the benefits of eating dark leafy greens to benefit our liver, especially in the spring which relates to the liver—and especially kale—I am delighted to share this recipe with you.

Because thanks to my new Kale recipe book, I have this new great suggestion for yet another way to squeeeeeeeeeze more kale into your daily diet.&nbsp;

Kale Hummus!

Adding onion makes it an even better immune boosting, liver-qi moving food.

Hummus is a great snack to have at work, and along with some cut celery and baby carrot sticks, makes an easy, healthy, nutrient and protein rich snack. Now that summer is around the corner and broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables will be making their way into our farmers markets, you can add even more delectable, and immune boosting, veggies into your snack routine.&nbsp;

And remember, the more greens you get into your diet during the springtime, the more happy your liver will be.

Once a week, I’ve been overnight soaking&nbsp; a bowl of dried garbanzos on the weekends, and boiling them in some salt for a couple hours, to be made into homemade hummus for the week.&nbsp; Then, I chop up a container full of veggies and bring them to work with me and keep them in the fridge for mid-week snacks in the clinic.&nbsp; Heck, you could even just wash up some kale leaves, cut off the stalk and wrap those around your Kale Hummus, bringing you even more Liver balancing, Immune Boosting nutrients.

Below is my beloved homemade hummus recipe, with the addition of kale; which is not from, but was inspired by,&nbsp; my kale cookbook.&nbsp; The portions are not exact. I have found that everyone likes things a little different, so I encourage you to play around with amounts of each ingredient until it tastes the way you like it.&nbsp; Citric Acid is my secret special ingredient to take away the real “beany” taste of the hummus and give it a good tangy tart that lemon juice alone won’t bring.

## Liver Balancing Kale Hummus Recipe

##### Ingredients:

* cooked garbanzo beans, maybe 2 cups (update: or steamed cauliflower if doing it paleo)
* A good long dollop of Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* tahini, maybe a few tbsps
* fresh chopped garlic (careful…raw garlic goes a long way!)
* Chopped onions, maybe 1/8 cup -what the heck…they’re not usually in hummus but go for it!
* Steamed Kale, chopped well before steaming, maybe 3-4 large leaves
* lemon juice- to taste
* salt
* pepper
* fresh Italian parsley, maybe 1/4 cup
* citric acid powder, maybe 1 tsp to tbsp-Whole foods should have it

Place all ingredients (except salt) into food processor or blender, along with some water to help it blend easily.&nbsp; Start off with less water and add as needed.&nbsp; Some, like me, like their hummus chunky, others like it smooth and creamy.&nbsp; It’s just up to you.

It’s a good idea to start with less tahini, garlic, and lemon juice also.&nbsp; Since everyone likes it different, there is no real right way.&nbsp; Just add more in of each one, blend it up, taste, and add more if needed.&nbsp; But tahini has a real strong flavor and some want that as the predominant taste, while others (me!) don’t like it as much.&nbsp; That’s why it’s best to start small and if you like the flavor as you add more, keep going.&nbsp; Add salt at the end, so that the other flavors have a chance to make it great before resorting to salt to spice it up.

Enjoy!!!
