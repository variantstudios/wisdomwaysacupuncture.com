During acupuncture treatments as well as out and about when I’m giving talks, people are usually fascinated when I start talking about the 5 Elements of acupuncture theory, because they reveal so much about what makes us tick, as well as the health issues we’re likely to encounter.

This video covers a very basic overview of each of the 5 elements. Although to really diagnose a person’s element is much more complex than just basing it on a simple explanation of the elements, this video might help you understand which element you sway towards.

If you want to find out more about each individual element, you can go to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvh0Z-0SVq60rqRQ1qMmkkA "Wisdom Ways Acupuncture YouTube channel"){: target="_blank"} where you’ll find videos detailing more specifics related to each one. So far, I’ve posted the Spring/Wood, Summer/Fire, Late-Summer/Earth, and Fall/Metal videos. (Winter/Water soon to come!) You can subscribe to my channel if you’d like updates when more videos are posted.
