During acupuncture treatments as well as out and about when I’m giving talks, people are usually fascinated when I start talking about the 5 Elements of acupuncture theory. This is because they reveal so much about not only what makes us tick, but also the health issues we’re likely to encounter.

This video covers a very basic overview of each of the 5 elements. Although diagnosing a person’s element is much more complex than just basing it on a simplistic explanation of the elements, this video might help you understand which element you sway towards.

If you want to find out more about each individual element, you can go back to the [home page](/) and click on the individual thumbnails for the related element. Or, you can go to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvh0Z-0SVq60rqRQ1qMmkkA "Wisdom Ways Acupuncture YouTube channel"){: target="_blank"} where you’ll also find the same videos.
