    If you&#8217;ve come for acupuncture recently or have been following my practice, then you know that since my last clinic building went on the market and was sold, I&#8217;ve been searching for a comfortable new office to call home.  <strong>I&#8217;ve finally found a place, and the good news is, it will be very convenient for everyone who has been to see me at my temporary location, because it is in the same park, only even more accessible.  It will now be right on and visible from Drake street, just west of Cuppies Coffee Shop in the same parking lot.  <em>The location is 363 W. Drake Road, Suite 1.</em></strong>

    The image above is the new clinic, which looks very much like where I&#8217;ve temporarily been located.  The windows shown are the actual windows of my new clinic, and right after entering into the lobby, you just turn to the left and you will see my office in suite 1.

  <strong>Please stay tuned to follow updates on the exact moving date.  As of now, the last week of January will be in my new location. </strong> If you have an appointment that week or are planning on coming in, we will just need to be in communication to make sure you know where you are going.  However, if for whatever reason you end up at my current location instead of the new, don&#8217;t worry&#8230;just park as usual, and walk to the building just in front of (towards Drake) and slightly to the east of my current office.  It will have the numbers 363 on it, and you can just take the sidewalk from my current parking lot to the front of that building, where my front doors will be.

  Thank you to everyone who has come to see me during this time of great transition and upheaval.  I know it is a huge inconvenience for everyone to have to keep finding me, and I greatly appreciate your ongoing loyalty!
