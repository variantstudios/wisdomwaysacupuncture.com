## Liver related symptoms get exacerbated in the Wood Element Season of acupuncture theory

As I wrote about in my “[chive](/2018/03/04/an-acupuncturists-insight-what-your-impatience-agitation-and-what-i-saw-in-my-garden-have-in-common/){: target="_blank"}” blog, it is common as an acupuncturist to see an increase in each season of symptoms related to the organ that is associated with that current season.&nbsp;

#### According to Chinese Medicine, Spring is associated with the Wood Season.&nbsp;

Therefore, many patients begin seeking acupuncture in the spring for increased or exacerbated symptoms related to Wood imbalances.

The Wood Element is related to the liver, and because the liver is an organ that wants to “move”, I find acupuncture to be extremely effective for any symptoms related to the liver.

One area where acupuncture excels is “moving” Qi, or life force energy.&nbsp; Western medicine would translate this into “increasing circulation”; or “activating the nervous system”, which is simply a series of electrical pathways in our body along which electricity, or energy, flows.&nbsp;

Because it is the liver’s nature to move rapidly, and in fact that is one of the “jobs” associated with the liver in Chinese Medicine; using acupuncture – which helps the energy move – immediately affects the liver.

## Blocked Qi and Liver Imbalance

One of the most common sources of liver related symptoms that I see in the acupuncture clinic is that associated with blocked Qi.&nbsp;

This most commonly manifests as:

* headaches or migraines
* menstrual irregularities or pain
* high blood pressure
* insomnia
* anxiety or unmanageable stress and depression
* digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome&nbsp;

Often, someone with blocked liver energy will have many or all of the above symptoms.&nbsp; The great news is, by simply getting the liver energy moving, all the symptoms are getting treated at the same time.

### Getting to the root of the problem

Once we get the liver energy moving, we need to think about and delve deeper into why the person’s liver energy is getting blocked in the first place.&nbsp; That is where we address prevention.

I will often work with my patients on dietary and lifestyle factors that are contributing, and give them practices or “homework” that they can do outside the treatment room to enhance the effects and prevent further issues.&nbsp;

We don’t just want to put a band-aid on the issue like western medicine does, so I work strongly with my patients to get them onboard with the plan. In that way we're not just “chasing symptoms” but actually resolving them.

*If you have any or all of the above symptoms, it may be worth scheduling an appointment to find out if they’re related to your liver…if they are, you could over the course of treatment have a quick resolution to symptoms that have been plaguing you for years.*
