The latest study on hot flashes revealed that acupuncture dramatically improved hot flashes for the study participants. The women were either given real or sham acupuncture, and those who received real acupuncture reported dramatic improvement after receiving their acupuncture treatments.

Participants received 2 acupuncture treatments per week for 10 weeks during the study period.

A huge chunk of my practice are women in the menopausal or perimenopausal years.&nbsp; This means not only do they commonly experience hot flashes, but also night sweats, insomnia, irregular menses (as they near full-on menopause), and restlessness or irritability.&nbsp;

Chinese medicine has proven effective for all of these issues, all without side effects or the use of harmful drugs.&nbsp; Most patients respond very well to a series of acupuncture treatments, especially when combined with tailor-made herbal formulas that were created for their individual needs, symptoms, and diagnosis.

If you’re having these symptoms, I’d love to help alleviate them!
