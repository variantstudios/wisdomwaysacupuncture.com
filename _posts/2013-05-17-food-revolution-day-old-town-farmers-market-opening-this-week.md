    Nothing signals the nearing of summer like the opening of our local farmer&#8217;s markets!  <strong>Tomorrow (Saturday), our very own Old Town Fort Collins market at 200 W. Oak Street opens at 8 am and goes til noon.</strong> While I may be an acupuncturist, I&#8217;m also a complete foodie, so I can&#8217;t wait for the opening of our local Old Town farmer&#8217;s market!

The reason I like the Old Town FM over the Lemay and Drake ones, is that _**they only allow local growers/producers, and they have the most farms with organic produce.**_ The other two (at least the Drake one) allow resellers, and have little to no organic farm booths. Having resellers at farmer&#8217;s markets defeats the entire purpose, because the produce could be shipped in from anywhere in the world.

Our late snow means that everything in the fields is somewhat delayed, but **I bet I can promise that you&#8217;ll find a lot of one big item&#8230;GREENS!  What could be better for your liver at this time of year?  Nothing really, so I hope you head on over to get the freshest and therefore healthiest produce available for you and your family.**

**<span style="color: #808000;">Food Revolution Day</span>**

**Food Revolution Day is today, Friday the 17th, but since our farmer&#8217;s market will not have opened yet, I personally am going to wait one more week and celebrate it next week, so that we locals here in FC can experience a true Food Revolution, of which shopping at farmer&#8217;s markets, and not grocery stores, is a part.** As I mentioned in a previous email, I would love for as many people as possible to join in this celebration, by joining together with friends, family, and/or community sometime this week, cooking up your idea of a great, homemade, healthy meal; and then posting pictures at either the <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001iYIyF_Q1yDgW26I3IJ10AKOvymgB41Z857C3dH9FyVV2gbLlJFf38nLv233i89lMd3BqASBR9OgGicCZn0ESOMoh7llsiknq0GbdvO18nMchrlcb0yBn0JXzkJbiEX4QJbdbN1de1bNbUg6T-L2xVA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food Revolution Website</a>, my Facebook Page, or both.  So, get your creative Foodie-hats on and start thinking about what YOU&#8217;D like to do for your own little Food Revolution.  **I personally can&#8217;t wait to hop on my bike tomorrow morning and make my way over to Old Town farmer&#8217;s market to welcome our very own local farmers back and enjoy a little of our great community.**
