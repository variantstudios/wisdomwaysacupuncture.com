We’re in the middle of winter, and that means in my acupuncture clinic I am commonly treating issues which have to do with the kidneys and bladder, the two organs associated with the [Water Element](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2018/01/12/the-depths-of-water-will-keep-you-balanced-this-winter/), according to Chinese Medicine.

Those issues can be obvious, such as frequent or difficult urination; or they can be mysterious to the non-Chinese Medicine practitioner, such as:

* headaches in the occipital region of the head
* feelings of deep and intractable coldness and/or fatigue
* unremitting and chronic diarrhea
* infertility
* low grade back pain not due to an injury or strain.

### My acupuncture patients

Right now, many of my patients seem to have kidney imbalances at the root of their issues, with some conglomeration of the aforementioned symptoms.&nbsp;

The best thing is, typically patients \*think\* they’re just coming in for their most debilitating issue, even if they have all or many of the above symptoms.&nbsp;

For one person it may be their headaches which impact their lives the most, for another it may be the diarrhea, for the next it may be the fatigue. &nbsp;

But in the treatment process, they start to understand that their symptoms are all related and therefore must be treated together, and one by one they notice their symptoms improving together as treatment progresses.&nbsp;

Many of my current patients are dealing with the above issues…or, should I say were, as they are all improving steadily and getting their lives back as their symptoms and overall energy, and therefore outlook on life, are improving.

#### Emotions of the Water Element

Speaking of outlook, when people have severe daily debilitating symptoms, fear is a common emotion that crops up, adding to the impact on their lives.&nbsp;

And indeed, fear is the emotion associated with the Water Element, Winter, and kidney imbalance.&nbsp;

As their kidneys get restored and their symptoms start improving, patient’s outlook and emotional state begins to improve as well.

As I’ve written in my last blog post, and will continue in my next post, the [kidneys store our root qi](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2017/12/29/is-your-jing-depleted/) deep inside our body.&nbsp; This qi easily gets drained, which will bring on the imbalance which causes these medical issues.&nbsp;

Having them resolved from the core is the best way to treat them; naturally, without harmful drugs, or invasive treatments.&nbsp; By simply increasing the vital Qi in the body, acupuncturists see many issues easily resolve on their own.

Do you have symptoms that worsen in the wintertime? If so, they may be related to a kidney imbalance. Either way, acupuncture can help resolve your health issues from their root.
