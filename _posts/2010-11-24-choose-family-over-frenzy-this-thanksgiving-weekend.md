For this week’s “wisdom”, I wanted to pass along an article that was sent to me today. I know we hear messages all the time reminding us to keep tabs on our consumerism over the holidays, and to put our attention on what really holds value in our lives, apart from doohickies and thingies.

…but then comes Black Friday…

<div><h2>Acupuncture theory&rsquo;s Metal Element, and its lessons regarding &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</h2><p>Despite the increased societal pressure to spend, a look into Chinese Medicine confirms the value of making this assessment at this time of year, as we are in the season of the <a href="http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2017/10/15/metal-element-video-live/">Metal element</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Metal is all about what is valuable&hellip;about staying focused on what really matters to us and letting all the rest go. (on page 40, check out a copy of my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2016/11/05/metal-season-the-time-for-learning-about-letting-go-but-that-whats-of-value-remains/">article on the Metal Element in Bella Sparks Magazine</a>)</p><p>Metal is also about sadness and depression when out of balance, and about wisdom and proper judgment when balanced.&nbsp; By staying focused on things that are truly valuable to us, like family, friends, our health, our community, etc.; we actually nourish our Metal, keeping ourselves more balanced&nbsp; and less prone to depression and sadness that easily come when we try to fill our lives with things that lack substance.</p><p>So keep this in mind as you read the short article below, and have a wonderful, wonderful holiday weekend!</p><h3>Choose Family over Frenzy&mdash;by Annie Leonard, of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=lem6kddab&amp;et=1103970353429&amp;s=0&amp;e=001ZEU46hwRMqFCDJRB5KjbStUt_lE59_dAKKh5n3kTc2ZxX4tP3NanYikYLc-iZ2k4FiIFRexTHlC1KxhpcdQKMKWr1CAQZrYRiEqxPSuHnFUP9-4J6D9qKg==">The Story of Stuff Project</a></h3><p>Tomorrow, in the United States, families and friends will gather around tables large and small to give Thanks together.</p><p>Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays (revisionist history aside). It is two full days during which many of us are liberated from work and school. It comes at a time when the days are getting shorter, trees have lost their leaves and we&rsquo;re pulling the sweaters out from the back of our overstuffed closets. It&rsquo;s the perfect time to cozy up and nest with friends and family. And, of course, remembering those who can&rsquo;t be with us.</p><p>Each Thanksgiving, I think of Marie Tellismond. Two years ago on Black Friday, Marie lost her 34 year-old son, Jdimytai Damour. Jimmy-as his friends called him-was trampled to death while trying to protect a pregnant woman from a stampede of bargain shoppers at a New York Walmart.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;ve never met Marie Tellismond, but as a fellow mother, I am pretty sure she would give anything to have a day with her son again. &nbsp;Losing, or even coming close to losing someone we love, makes us get our priorities straight really, really fast.</p><p>Most of us have a choice this Friday that Marie no longer has. &nbsp;We can chose to leave the warmth of our beds before dawn, to sit in our cars in a parking lot at some mall and to spend the day searching for low prices on products which we don&rsquo;t really need and often don&rsquo;t event want, but getting them is all part of the Black Friday Frenzy. &nbsp;Or we have a choice to stay put with loved ones, to play board games and eat leftovers and maybe even play a game of football together.</p><p>If we&rsquo;re going to figure out how to build an economy and society that is healthy for people and the planet, this Friday is a good place to start. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s opt out of the frenzy this year.</p></div>
