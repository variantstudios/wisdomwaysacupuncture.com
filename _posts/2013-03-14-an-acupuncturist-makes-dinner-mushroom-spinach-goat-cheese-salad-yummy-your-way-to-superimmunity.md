  <strong>Every acupuncturist knows that as we head into spring, it is more important than ever to keep our livers happy</strong>.  Acupuncture theory states that the spring season is related to the Wood Element (more on this in the coming weeks) and the Liver organ; and that greens are one of the best foods we can eat to keep our livers balanced. <strong>With what we&#8217;re learning about what western nutrition philosophy says about the foods in this salad, whether we steer more the modern or traditional route, we can&#8217;t go wrong by trying this one out.</strong>

  <strong>If you&#8217;d like to start trying my food recommendations but are not sure where to start, here&#8217;s the recipe for a quick easy dinner that I threw together the other night, from foods I already had in my fridge.</strong> It took just minutes to make, was absolutely delicious, and could not be better for nourishing your immune system and balancing your liver, as we head into Spring.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br /> Spinach<br /> Mushrooms<br /> Olive Oil<br /> Onion<br /> garlic<br /> goat cheese (goat dairy is much easier to process and less damp forming)<br /> walnuts<br /> avocado<br /> vinegar
</p>

Mince garlic.  Slice onion in thin slices. Heat a little olive oil on medium heat, and add the onions and mushrooms and constantly stir until softening and shrinking.  Add the garlic and salt and pepper to taste and continue to stir until the mushrooms are much darker and smaller.  While that&#8217;s cooking, throw the spinach in a large serving bowl and add some goat cheese chunks. Also, chop the walnuts and avocado into chunks.  In a small bowl, combine some olive oil and good quality balsamic vinegar to taste, and toss into the bowl.  Mix everything together and then just when you&#8217;re ready to serve, pour the hot mushrooms on top of the salad and gently mix.  This will just soften and warm the spinach, making it much easier for people who do not tolerate raw foods well.

Of course, you could substitute the superfood Kale, just make sure you chop it well first, and steam a little bit before serving.  Many people can not eat completely raw kale.

**Enjoy!**
