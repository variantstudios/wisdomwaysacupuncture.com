  <strong>Phyoo, what a summer it&#8217;s been in the acupuncture clinic! In fact, what a year it&#8217;s been!  There has been much growth and change over here at Wisdom Ways Acupuncture, and I look forward to the new foundations making things even better. </strong>
</div>

<span style="color: #808000;"><strong>It&#8217;s my anniversary!</strong></span>

**First, this weekend marks the year anniversary of my move from the clinic on Boardwalk Drive.** Many of you know that I settled into a gorgeous and sweet new space on Drake Road. **T**his new clinic is beautiful, peaceful, centrally located, and truly feels like the space I have always wanted. So I hope any of you who have not had a chance to check it out can come in soon!

**<span style="color: #808000;">Going digital!</span>** 

**Second, I&#8217;m completely changing my basic systems to go completely electronic.** That means all charting, accounting, and practice management tools will now be in one location! No more opening up 4 separate programs just to create your insurance superbill for you for your past visits! While this is going to be a HUGE convenience in the long run, and will streamline all procedures so that I can handle a larger patient load, right now it&#8217;s been a labor of love. :-) Hours and hours of scanning in charts, data entry tasks, and a big learning curve!  Thank you to everyone who has been with me through the transition**.**

**<span style="color: #808000;">Insurance</span>**

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Third, I am now taking insurance! I am currently in network with Cigna, and in process of joining Blue Cross and United, which should happen any day.  I will be able to accept several smaller insurance companies as well, and more will likely be added as the new Affordable Care Act kicks in. </strong>Going forward, anyone who has insurance that covers acupuncture can now just pay their co-pay with me and I will bill for the rest. (this will not apply to treatments that were already purchased, this can be used for any FUTURE treatment purchases, and must be billed individually, not as a package)

  <strong><span style="color: #808000;">That&#8217;s it for now and so I repeat&#8230;phyoo! What a year it&#8217;s been at Wisdom Ways Acupuncture!</span></strong>
