As an acupuncturist I am very interested in health and longevity&#8230;therefore, the year 2012 is an exciting time in the Chinese calendar!

2012 is the year of Dragon. Some people call it more specifically  a Black Dragon or Water Dragon year.  Either way, from a Feng Shui standpoint, the arrival of the year of the Dragon is most welcome, because it brings many possibilities for good fortune.

The Dragon is _the_ major symbol of good fortune in Chinese Astrology, and according to tradition brings in the Four Blessings of the East: wealth, virtue, harmony and longevity.

With the economic challenges and increase in natural disasters, many around the world have had unusually difficult times over the last few years. Therefore, many believe that the good luck the Dragon brings is timely and very needed!

So as we venture into this new year together, I wish everyone longevity&#8230;and the wealth, virtue, and harmony that make that longevity fulfilling!
