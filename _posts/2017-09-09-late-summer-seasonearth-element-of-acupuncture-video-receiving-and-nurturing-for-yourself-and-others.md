Hello and welcome to [Earth Element Season](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2011/09/10/late-summer-is-the-most-important-time-to-nourish-your-qi/)! — an extra season that we recognize in Chinese medicine called “Late Summer”.

Since what we do/eat now will have one of the biggest impacts on whether we have a vibrant, or a tired and sick cold season ahead, it’s crucial that we do as much as possible to [boost the Qi](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2011/09/07/out-of-the-fire-and-deep-into-earth/) in our [Earth Element](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2016/08/21/acupuncture-tips-from-the-earth-element-for-staying-balanced-in-late-summer/) organs over the next several weeks.
