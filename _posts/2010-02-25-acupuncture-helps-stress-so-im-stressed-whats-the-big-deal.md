    Stress relates the Liver in acupuncture theory, so if we're stressed, we get
    other symptoms related to Liver imbalance as well.

The most frequent imbalances I treat in my acupuncture practice are those due to stress. More accurately, these imbalances are not just due to stress – stress IS the imbalance.

In other words, stress is both the cause and result of, liver imbalance.&nbsp; Which means that it’s not sufficient to just “handle the stress well” and write it off as not a big deal, because it’s inseparable from the body imbalances which come with it.

## Acupuncture helps stress

Symptoms that occur due to an imbalance of Liver Qi caused by stress are most commonly:&nbsp; headaches/migraines, digestive issues (like IBS or constipation), insomnia (typically wakening between 1-3 a.m.) and fatigue.&nbsp; Not to mention the obvious symptoms of depression and anxiety.

When our body is balanced and relaxed, our Qi flows smoothly, which is a function of what we think of as the Liver.&nbsp; When our qi flows smoothly, the energy needed reaches our organs and tissues, and they function optimally and we are symptom free.

Stress interrupts this flow of Qi, with the result of weakened organs. This causes a vicious cycle which somehow must be broken to avoid following a path that surely leads to dis-ease.

## Acupuncture helps stress even in “the worst” cases

Often, people walk in my door stating that they are a “train wreck”, or a “total mess”.&nbsp; They have symptoms in almost every organ system of their body, and after months or years of dealing with this, their quality of life is practically non-existent.&nbsp; They are hopeless and depressed, not knowing “what’s wrong” with them, and therefore not knowing a solution.

When I go through their symptoms, and show them how they all boil down to one simple cause, to say they are relieved is an understatement.&nbsp; Many have actually thought they might be dying!

### How did we get so stressed?

Our western culture tells us to go go go, to produce at all costs, and to simply ignore the needs and signals of the body by popping pills. We have not been raised to understand that stress is simply intolerable to our system and must be regulated.

Thousands of years ago, the East developed practices for moderating stress, such as Yoga, Tai Qi, Qi Gong, and Meditation. We can learn from the East and incorporate these practices into our days as much as possible.

Acupuncture is a great adjunct to what you’re doing on your own, to maintain wellness.

But it can’t do the job on its own. The more we can follow practices that regulate our Qi by reducing stress, the greater a state of wellness we will live in.

Regular acupuncture treatments, herbal prescriptions, correct dietary habits, and the practices listed above; are all great ways to facilitate ease and wellness in our body.

We must learn that reducing stress is not a luxury, but a necessity, and one that will reward you with greater levels of happiness, strength, and well-being.
