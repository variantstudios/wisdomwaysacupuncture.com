## <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Right now, there is a huge problem withing the field of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine.</strong></span>

**Currently, many insurance companies cover acupuncture services, BUT ONLY IF ADMINISTERED BY AN M.D.**

**Of course, this makes no sense at all, because MD&#8217;s are not required to have ANY acupuncture education at all,** even though some do elect to go through a 100-300 hour program (compared to our often 3,500 hours) to learn &#8220;medical acupuncture&#8221;.  Medical acupuncture does not use the underlying theories of Chinese Medicine, and in fact, many acupuncturists believe that doctors don&#8217;t even realize that they aren&#8217;t even practicing Chinese Medicine when they do acupuncture.

## <span style="color: #808000;">How long does it take to become proficient at Acupuncture?</span>

Acupuncture is a HIGHLY skilled field which requires YEARS of school to master, and expertise in western medicine does not have any relevance whatsoever on whether one will be adept at practicing acupuncture.  Just as mastery of one language does not automatically enable one to speak a completely foreign language, mastery of western medicine says nothing about a doctor&#8217;s ability to use Chinese medicine for the benefit of their patients.

**But many more people are wanting to receive acupuncture, and are only able to have it covered under their insurance plans if administered by an MD.  This severely limits both patient&#8217;s and legitimate acupuncturist&#8217;s ability to get connected with each other for the purpose of effective treatment.**

That is why the bill [HB 1186](http://extras.denverpost.com/app/bill-tracker/bills/2011a/hb_11-1186/) has been put forth, which will enable fair and equitable treatment for acupuncture within the insurance industry.  **It simply says that any acupuncture services which are already covered can be received by a licensed acupuncturist.** IT DOES NOT FORCE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER ACUPUNCTURE.

**By enabling patients to get the treatment that would like to receive, by a legitimately trained and licensed acupuncturist, and have it be covered by their insurance, we help both patients as well as acupuncturists.**

Please write to your representative and urge them to support HB 1186!  Here in Fort Collins you can write to Bob Bacon at <bob.bacon.senate@state.co.us> 

**Simply state in the email that you would like him to support HB 1186 so that fully trained acupuncturists can be covered under insurance plans that currently cover acupuncture.**

Thank you for your support!
