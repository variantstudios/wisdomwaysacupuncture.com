 **I swear the universe is conspiring to get more kale on this acupuncturist&#8217;s plate.** One of the things I love most about doing acupuncture is that each time I talk to my patients or blog to readers about some facet of health, I am reinforcing it in my own life.  As you know, I&#8217;ve been writing about kale _a lot_ lately.

**There&#8217;s a quote you may have read before, &#8220;If you want to learn something, read. If you want to understand something, write. If you want to master something, teach.&#8221;** Whenever things get super busy, I stop sending educational emails out.  I&#8217;m then less focused on food and living in balance, because I&#8217;m not talking about it, writing about it, or thinking about it as much.  Sure, as an acupuncturist I work with it every day with my patients, but in order to sit down and share a blog or email, I really have to chew on things and give them some thought.

**Well, along with the mastery that comes as habits integrate themselves into our lives when we teach them, there is the phenomenon that we can probably all relate to: as soon as you start focusing on something, it seems it is suddenly everywhere around you.** **And for sure&#8230;my life seems to be inundated with kale lately. :-)**

**As an example, recently I came across a cookbook I had never seen before, and lo and behold, it was a <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001YN9phbhoq0d4iPz6m8D64ITmcx-T4KzFNNlrLSL3KNUtHWx6ISzYjqdjzBZM8gZNWC4P6LIk3yiWr1hs6NJFssTIdMUCGrgyA65ODzy2BJbWe7CFj0H_Pi9kxv_Kpj5AMR4G6RZNkj9rhStVE2WJBlZRU_2K-xfV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cookbook</a> completely about&#8230;you guessed it, Kale!** **Being a cookbook freak, I was surprised to have never come across this one before.** Guess how many seconds it took me to decide I needed to order it.  And guess whether I&#8217;m going to be sharing new recipe ideas with you as I try them out. :-)

**The day my book arrived I went to a potluck at a friend&#8217;s house.  Now you have to understand, kale is about the last thing I expect to be served when I go over to friend&#8217;s houses. Most of my friends are not foodies, and certainly, this one is not.** But I arrived this night to a kitchen teaming with well-dressed people scurrying around the kitchen and tending to a stove with every burner full of some form of fresh vegetable dish.  In no time some kind of veggie-meat concoction was being ladled into perfectly beautiful baked butternut squash halves, to be thrown into the oven for their final roasting.  It looked like I&#8217;d walked right onto a cooking show!  This unusual experience was occurring only because my friend had some out of town guests over, and I knew instantly that like me, they were foodies. I was absolutely delighted and documented the unfolding food extravaganza with clicks of my iphone camera.

**But the real kicker was when I sat down to eat.  Suddenly a huge ceramic bowl was placed in the middle of the table, and someone plopped an enormous pile of kale salad onto my plate.** All I could do was look down and chuckle, because to be sure, this was the first time ever, that I had gone to a friends house in Colorado, and been served kale.  **And this wasn&#8217;t just a little kale, this was like the heavens opening up to me and yelling &#8220;you WILL eat kale, there is no escape!&#8221;  I felt like I was right in the middle of a Kale Conspiracy!** The best part was when the chef saw the stunned look on my face as I stared down into this unexpected mountain range of kale, and asked &#8220;uh oh&#8230;do you not like kale?&#8221;.  As we ate, he then proceeded to talk about what a powerful superfood it is, how it gets the highest score on the <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001YN9phbhoq0d4iPz6m8D64ITmcx-T4KzFNNlrLSL3KNUtHWx6ISzYjqdjzBZM8gZNWC4P6LIk3yi2zC0sqV4oNMPhRnQNa8kR2r9B_QTtQskc5P91GgQjhnjSLS7DURE0wNzD-YAJxnw=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANDI scale</a>, and on and on.  Sounds familiar?  I was tickled pink.  (or, should I say green&#8230;). :-)

**In pondering this evening later, I thought about something.  I remembered how before moving to Colorado, it was so easy to keep good eating habits because for 15 years, every single person I knew also shopped at the health food store, ate organic, and cooked from scratch.** Over the years I&#8217;d pick up on recipes here and there from housemates, and slowly but surely, my tastes were changing and mastery at concocting fresh whole meals developed.  A lot of this happened simply through the process of osmosis, absorbing the habits of my community and having them reinforced in my own life. **I thought about how much more likely we are to eat healthy when we&#8217;re doing it with others rather than trying to tackle it on our own, ending up eating solo a lot if we don&#8217;t want to make unhealthy food choices&#8211;and after all, that gets lonely  and unrealistic really fast.  And I realized that without knowing it, even I was rubbing off on my current non-foodie friends; that same friend who hosted the party had told me she was putting in a garden this year.**

**What is your &#8220;eating community&#8221; like?  Would it help you to make better food choices if you were doing it with others?  If you feel this could benefit you, why not start a regular potluck night, maybe just once per month, where you all commit to bringing one meal, that you&#8217;ve made all from scratch.** **Learn and teach together.** **Talk about how you feel after you eat it.  Do you feel the absolute buzz going through your body that I feel after a really healthy home-cooked meal full of veggies?** Maybe even start your own Kale Conspiracy!!!

I decided also that I&#8217;d love to see what all of you make and have my own little Food Revolution event where you all post pics on my new  <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001YN9phbhoq0d4iPz6m8D64ITmcx-T4KzFNNlrLSL3KNUtHWx6ISzYjpkfgQiaPrSTFZy2bNjjlcef5dMVckp5OvNPt6AYQpFv1pq97H6FCua5bRIxOpFnfo1ALt7Jp5FoHrXnPQJwhurtUYLyqJCMHA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisdom Ways Acupuncture</a> Facebook page that I&#8217;m just getting up and running, so we could see what everyone else is doing and join in on the fun!

**What will you do with your friends and family?  Spread the word!  (Just remember&#8230;lets see lots of kale in those pics!)** :-)
