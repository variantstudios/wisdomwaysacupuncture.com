Can you guess the leading cause of death in the US?

Is it heart disease?&nbsp; Cancer?&nbsp; Perhaps Diabetes has taken over?

If you guessed any of these, you should be correct.&nbsp; But in fact, the leading cause of death in the US is something much more insidious…it is Western Medicine.

###### &nbsp;

Now I’m not out to harp on or degrade Western Medicine and say acupuncture is the answer for everything…allopathy is an amazingly powerful medicine that is the first choice for emergency and urgent care because it excels in crisis situations.&nbsp; But it is not so great when it come to chronic illness or wellness care.

In fact, many have suggested changing the name of Western Medicine from “health care” to “sick care”, because it only knows how to treat people who are already sick (and often makes them sicker) — not how to care for or keep people well.

Unfortunately, not only does western medicine not treat people who are well, statistics show that if you wind up in the doctors office, chances are, you may not leave.

“According to the groundbreaking 2003 medical report [Death by Medicine](http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2004/mar2004_awsi_death_01.htm "Death by Medicine"){: target="_blank"}, by Drs. Gary Null, Carolyn Dean, Martin Feldman, Debora Rasio and Dorothy Smith, 783,936 people in the United States die every year from conventional medicine mistakes. That’s the equivalent of six jumbo jet crashes a day for an entire year…And that’s a conservative estimate; only a fraction of medical errors are reported, according to the study.“

–Excerpt from Natural News.com

Seems our advances in modern medicine have come with quite a price tag…and unfortunately that cost often means a life. To put this in perspective:

Deaths from:

* Western Medicine: +783,936 (this number is from 2003 and I’ve heard it’s even much higher now)
* Heart disease: 616,067
* Cancer: 562,875
* Stroke: 135,952
* Accidents (unintentional injuries): 123,706
* Diabetes: 71,382

##### Why don’t we ever hear about this?&nbsp;

And why is it just accepted that a certain percentage of allowable deaths will occur from everyday medications? Especially when if even one death happens from a Chinese herb or acupuncture—even if they’re used by someone who’s not even trained to use them correctly—that death is used as “proof” of how bogus, dangerous, and unsafe the medicine is.

All I know is, every day in my acupuncture practice I see people who have been getting treated by the “real” medicine — yet they either had no desirable response, or the side effects were worse than the symptom they were taking the medication for.&nbsp; So they come to me to try something new, and for many, they become free of symptoms they’ve had for maybe half their lives or longer.

On top of that, they suddenly have energy, their sleep normalizes, and their stress levels go way down. All without dangerous side effects, without invasive procedures, and totally in harmony with their body’s own energy and healing powers.&nbsp; Now that’s what I call health care!

#### Hippocrates, who is known as the father of modern medicine, wrote “First, do no harm”.

It is time we reprioritize…begin making “primary medicine” the natural forms of medicine that actually boost up health and prevent illness, as opposed to drug-based medicine that relies on a steady supply of sicker and sicker people to keep its well-oiled profit machine running smoothly.&nbsp; They say the leading cause of illness is diet related, yet doctors are not even required to take nutrition courses!&nbsp; Instead, they spend years learning about which drugs to give people once the food they’re eating makes them sick. Very fancy!

Now I should also report that there is some disagreement with the actual numbers, and JAMA, a leading medical journal, published their own numbers in a publication authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. These numbers are as follows, totaling 225,00 deaths per year at the hands of western medicine:

* 12,000 — unnecessary surgery
* 7,000 — medication errors in hospitals
* 20,000 — other errors in hospitals
* 80,000 — infections in hospitals
* 106,000 — non-error, negative effects of drugs

These numbers still put western medicine almost right up at the top, as the 3rd leading cause of death.

So despite which numbers we use, let’s all keep making the choice together.

Something is *seriously* broken with modern medicine, and the only way it will change is if patients just continue to refuse to be a part of it and turn towards other safer, healthier ways of caring for themselves.&nbsp; Share these statistics with someone you love, and encourage them to make the safest choice in their own health care.

##### Wellness and natural medicine…the NEW health care. :-)
