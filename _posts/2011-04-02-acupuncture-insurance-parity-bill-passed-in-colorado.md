**It&#8217;s a great week in the world of Acupuncture in the United States, and particularly Colorado.  A bill just passed, and will be signed into legislation soon, that requires insurance companies that cover acupuncture to accept claims from real, licensed acupuncturists.**

### <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Why this matters for both Acupuncturists and Patients</strong></span>

**Up until now, insurance companies could deny reimbursement to legitimate acupuncturists while accepting claims from medical doctors or chiropractors who are practicing so called &#8220;acupuncture&#8221;; which left thousands of patients with no choice but to receive substandard care, or none at all.** 

**Many different types of medical professionals are legally allowed to insert needles, many with zero to only 2 or 3 hundred hours of schooling (compared to over 3,000 of licensed acupuncturists); but only legitimately trained licensed acupuncturists, who went through the entire Chinese Medical School program, are really qualified to practice traditional Chinese medicine.** 

**Now, patients can get the best care, as well as reimbursement! ** 

**I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s progress!**
