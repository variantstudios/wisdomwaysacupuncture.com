<div>Have you ever made a frittata?</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I learned a recipe for a simple frittata using artichoke hearts several years ago, and I&rsquo;ve been making it over and over again ever since.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Some people think that as an acupuncturist and a healthy eater, I must not eat very interesting or yummy food.&nbsp; This recipe proves that you can eat like an acupuncturist and still feel satisfied and fulfilled!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It&rsquo;s not only a great make-ahead breakfast, allowing for a nutritious start to my mornings even when I don&rsquo;t have time to cook, but its flavor and presentation make it a great party pleaser too.</div>

### Liver Balancing recipe adaptation

For this recipe, I’ve adapted the ingredients to be more medicinal for springtime by substituting liver-balancing foods (yes that’s right…that means greens greens greens, the acupuncturist’s favorite springtime food). I’m using ingredients that I’ve been writing about in my [series on the immune system](/2013/02/13/why-are-people-constantly-sick-in-colorado-part-i/).

You can simply adapt the amount of ingredients to the size of your group or the amount of leftovers you would like to have.&nbsp; When I’m just making it for myself and wanting leftovers, I’ll use about 8 eggs and a medium sized skillet.&nbsp; When cooking for a crowd I use an entire carton of eggs and a large skillet.

You’ll need either a cast-iron skillet or another such pan with high straight sides, which can be transferred from stove-top to broiler.

##### Ingredients:

* eggs, at least 8 for a medium sized pan
* olive oil
* onions, chopped
* garlic, minced
* kale, chopped well&nbsp; to activate those immune boosting enzymes (go ahead, throw tons in, it’ll cook right down!)
* mushrooms, sliced
* 1 can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
* gruyere cheese, grated (to taste, but I use a hunk about 5 or so oz.) (update: since going paleo I just make this recipe without cheese, and it still works!)
* Fresh basil leaves when in season, otherwise a tsp or so of dried
* salt and pepper

##### Directions:

Turn the oven on to broil.

Heat olive oil in skillet on medium high, be sure to get some olive oil up onto the pan sides to avoid sticking. Add onions and mushrooms and saute until just getting soft, a couple minutes.&nbsp; Add the garlic and saute another minute or two, being sure to stir often so the garlic doesn’t burn.&nbsp; Add the kale, and saute until just softening and bright green.&nbsp; While this is cooking, crack all the eggs into a bowl and scramble, and mix in dried basil if not using fresh, as well as salt and pepper to taste.&nbsp; (or, do this beforehand if multi-tasking in the kitchen is not your strong suit)&nbsp; Lay out the quartered artichoke hearts evenly across the pan.&nbsp; Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the pan, and then pour the egg mixture evenly over this.&nbsp; It should just cover the ingredients. If using fresh basil, place some leaves over the cheese mixture, and then pour the eggs on top of this.

Cover the pan and let cook on low for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; The sides should be setting. &nbsp; Transfer entire dish (no lid) to the broiler and cook on high for about 5 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.&nbsp; Watch to make sure it’s not burning.

##### Tips:

The larger your frittata is, the longer you will need to cook it on low on the stove top to make sure the eggs cook through.

Slice into even pie wedges and serve immediately, or let cool and refrigerate for eating at room temperature later.&nbsp; I like to throw a slice into the toaster oven while I’m getting ready in the morning, for a quick nutritious breakfast on the run.

Enjoy!
