## <span style="color: #808000;"><b>Natural Fertility vs. ART/IVF</b></span>

If you’re hoping to get pregnant naturally, feel better than ever once baby comes; and you have or are willing to take the time and potentially make some necessary lifestyle changes to bring that about, then you’re probably a great fit for our practice!

**For two reasons, I have chosen to focus my fertility/infertility work specifically with women who are trying to get pregnant without the use of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)**.

Before I explain why though, I want to make it clear that I have nothing against IVF or western ART treatments; they have certainly proved miraculous for many women and in some cases are the only option.

### <span style="color: #808000;">Two vastly different fertility treatment goals</span>

But I quickly discovered, after working more and more with infertility in my clinic, that to work with ART patients meant dividing my work and brain between two &#8212; often conflicting &#8212; goals and realities. ****

**My number one goal with every patient who walks through my door, is to restore balance and wellness to their system.** That is my passion, that’s why I love this medicine, and it’s what makes me excited to go to work every day.

When treating IVF patients though, the goal is different: do everything possible to support the IVF treatment, often using protocol-based (i.e. not individualized) treatments based on modern studies; and increase the women’s wellness in the process as much as possible.

## <span style="color: #808000;">So my reasons I decided to only focus on natural fertility are as follows:</span>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #808000;">1) C</span><span style="color: #808000;">hinese Medicine tries to SOLVE the problem, ART goes around it</span>
</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  While our treatments during ART definitely improve a woman’s tolerance of and successful results from the ART, it’s not at all about correcting the underlying imbalances that are causing her infertility in the first place &#8212; ART is <i>going around</i> those problems, and we’re just supporting that process.  And that is <i>great,</i> for the many acupuncturists and patients who work with ART.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  But it’s just not the work that I’m passionate about.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The goal was feeling like BABY!, while my goal with women is WELLNESS and RESTORING HEALTHY/NORMAL FUNCTION. <b>When we work with natural fertility, we believe that barring specific circumstances, fertility is the </b><b><i>natural outcome</i></b><b> of wellness and healthy/normal physiological functions.  </b>
</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #808000;">2) I wanted to get REALLY REALLY GOOD at treating Natural Fertility</span>
</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  My second reason for choosing to refer out for women undergoing ART, is that I realized that I can only get really good at and master, a limited number of medical perspectives. I found that keeping up on all the changing medical protocols, latest reproductive technology, new studies refuting the last ones; was time taken away from learning more and more and getting better and better at using Chinese medicine to help solve the underlying problems causing the infertility.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Again, my brain just felt divided, and while I realize I&#8217;m in the minority in terms of acupuncture fertility specialists; for me, I had to make a choice. Likely if infertility was the only condition I treated, I would have the capacity to work well in both worlds.
</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #808000;">3) I felt my hands were tied by the constraints of the western treatment<br /> </span>
</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Lastly, one of the most vital aspects of treatment for restoring healthy reproductive function, is herbs.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Women using ART are using medicated hormone protocols and there&#8217;s a great divide between those who believe herbs are not only not damaging to use during stimulated cycles but <em>necessary</em>; and those who say we can&#8217;t put our patients on herbs during stimulated cycles. I happen to be in the camp that believes that anything we do that helps improve the body&#8217;s function will only benefit and improve the outcome of hormone stim cycles. And I believe herbs help.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  But I don&#8217;t get to make that choice. Instead, as acupuncturists just supporting the ART process, we defer to the recommendations of the RE, which in many cases means we don&#8217;t get to prescribe herbs.
</p>

### **<span style="color: #808000;">Acupuncture is still fabulous for assisting ART</span>** 

I still believe acupuncture is an amazing support for women going through ART. Many more studies than not show the benefits and improved outcomes when acupuncture is paired with western treatments. If nothing else, the stress reduction alone is worth using it, since IVF is notoriously stressful.
