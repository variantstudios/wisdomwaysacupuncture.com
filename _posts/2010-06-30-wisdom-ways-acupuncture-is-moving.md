After much consideration, I am very excited to announce that on July 1 **I will be moving my acupuncture practice just a few minutes north** into the beautiful and quiet Nature&#8217;s Healing Center.  **This office offers a serene and tranquil atmosphere that will help facilitate relaxation from the moment you walk into the waiting room.** (Hint: no more chiropractic drop-table BANGS! outside the door while you relax with your acupuncture needles!)

And while it does not fit the ultimate needs of my practice as in the near future I want space to offer Qi Gong/Tai Ji classes, an in-house Chinese herbal pharmacy, as well as space for my &#8220;dream team&#8221; of local health care providers (including naturopathic doctor, holistic minded western MD and others) who really fit my vision of how we practice and deliver our care, **it will be an incredibly sweet temporary place in which to do what I love doing best: being in the room with my patients, doing acupuncture.**

**I will still be located in South Fort Collins, just a tad bit more central.** **_But to make up for the inconvenience of finding me at my new practice, and to say thank you for the 2 years you spent with me in my old acupuncture clinic, I will be offering Acupuncture Package Specials through the month of July._** Stay tuned for more info!
