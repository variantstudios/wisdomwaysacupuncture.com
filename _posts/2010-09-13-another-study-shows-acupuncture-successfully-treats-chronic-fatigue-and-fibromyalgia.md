It is absolutely unnecessary to be endlessly debilitated by Chronic Fatigue or Fibromyalgia.&nbsp;

But as the days get colder and shorter as we progress into fall, I begin to see an increase in patients coming in for acupuncture with these symptoms.

## Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia in the Acupuncture Clinic

A major increase in symptoms in the winter months can be explained by the fact that Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia is often due to depleted Qi, and according to Chinese Medicine the [depth of winter](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2018/01/12/the-depths-of-water-will-keep-you-balanced-this-winter/) is when the Qi in nature is at the lowest point in its cycle through the seasons.

For some people, even now as the days have begun to shorten dramatically, they feel their symptoms coming on.&nbsp; Luckily, acupuncture and Chinese herbs are extremely effective in treating this condition; and using a combination of the two, I have had almost a 100% success rate in my practice when patients follow the recommended treatment.

### Studies show acupuncture helps

In a study reported in the journal "Medical Acupuncture: A Journal for Physicians by Physicians", results showed the overall functional level of participants improved, and they reported both improved sleep and energy. The duration of the reported effectiveness of the acupuncture treatments was lengthened as the treatments progressed. The researchers therefore concluded that acupuncture can be a useful tool for the management of this condition.

In another study using a treatment and control group, after one month of treatment, the total amelioration rate in the treatment group was 92%, while it was only 64% in the comparison (non-acupuncture) group.

### Personal success with treating Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia with Acupuncture

In my practice, it is not an exaggeration to say that I have almost a 100% recovery rate with Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia. I say “almost”, because I’ve noticed it’s common for patients to need to return for a round of treatment at the beginning of each fall. Or, to need occasional continued support, or “maintenance” to maintain their improvement.

Why is this?

* First, as I mentioned before, as the energy in nature wanes around us, our stored energy wanes as well.
* Second, we all have our weak links in our bodies, made worse by our lifestyle habits.&nbsp; Overwork, stress, and not eating well…all the things we all KNOW deplete us, continue to chip away at our weak link, over time causing the need for rebalancing. This can actually happen at any time of year, and is not just limited to fall.
* Third, while some patients go from practically disabled to pretty well-functioning, they may have a hard time progressing to really thriving.&nbsp; They might get dramatic improvement that feels like a success to them, but then reach a plateau. In almost every case this is due to lifestyle factors mentioned.&nbsp; So, I don’t count these as 100% recovered.

Because [Late Summer/Earth](/2016/08/21/acupuncture-tips-from-the-earth-element-for-staying-balanced-in-late-summer/) time is related to the muscle tissue as well as to the organs of digestion, this is another great reason to treat muscle issues/pain during this time of year, in addition to the digestive issues spoken about in the seasonal article.

Remember…no one need be debilitated by Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia!
