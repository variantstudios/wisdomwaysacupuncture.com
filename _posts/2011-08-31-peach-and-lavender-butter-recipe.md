This recipe, adapted from: [Canning & Preserving, by Ashley English, ](https://www.amazon.com/Homemade-Living-Canning-Preserving-Chutneys/dp/1600594913/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1528935587&sr=8-1&keywords=Canning+%26+Preserving%2C+by+Ashley+English)is AMAZING and is a great way to put up the summer harvest.

I just visited the farmer&#8217;s market and got an enormous flat of gorgeous local peaches. As someone who loves supporting our local farmers I sometimes have huge amounts of seasonal foods with which I need to get creative. Combining the peaches with the lavender from my garden made an incredible treat that I&#8217;ll be able to enjoy all winter. You can also just get bulk lavender at most health food stores.

Due to copyright laws, I cannot give the recipe in its entirety, so if you don’t know how to can already I would suggest either looking online, or getting a general canning book that will explain all the steps and necessary safety precautions.

##### **<span style="color: #800000;">(By following this recipe you must understand the grave health dangers in canning without following the precise methods.  If food is not properly preserved, it can result in death by bacterial growth.)</span>**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients:</span>

3 pounds peaches ~ ½ cup water ~ 2 tbs. fresh or dried lavender buds ~ 3 tbs. bottled lemon juice (yes, you must use bottled to make sure the acid content is consistent enough for safety) ~ 1 ½ tbs lemon zest ~ 1 cup Sugar (this is not how much she uses…I use way less than indicated)

  1. Blanch the peaches and when they are cool enough, peel and pit and roughly chop.
  2. Bring 1/3 cup water to a boil and steep lavender buds in this for 15 minutes and then drain, putting the buds aside to be added later.
  3. Combine lavender water, peaches, lemon juice and lemon zest in a large pot and boil then simmer for 15 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and clings to a spoon.
  4. Let cool slightly and then puree.
  5. Return puree to pan and add sugar and lavender buds.  Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 25 minutes.
  6. Follow canning instructions, processing for 15 minutes for Fort Collins elevation.

Notes: The reason I’ve started making only butters and not jams or jellies is because it requires only the amount of sugar you would like to use, since it doesn’t have to become gelatinous.  Precision is not necessary with butters, so I reduce the sugar by about 2/3 with every recipe, and it still tastes perfectly sweet to me!

**Enjoy!!! :-)**
