Of course it is, but if you’re someone who can practically never warm up, no matter well you’re bundled or how warm you keep the house, then acupuncturists would say there may be more going on than just the weather.  Many of my acupuncture patients have what we call Yang Deficiency in Chinese medicine.  Put very basically, Yin and Yang symbolize opposite qualities, and we need both, working through all our organ systems, to be healthy and vibrant.  Yin is what keeps us cool, relaxed, able to sleep, and nourished.  Yang is what warms us up, drives our organ functions, and gives us energy throughout the day.  If we are deficient in yang, for whatever reasons, we will start to feel cold.

### <span style="color: #808000;">Other symptoms of Yang Deficiency</span>

But yang deficiency can often manifest in other symptoms as well.  All our organs need yang energy to function, and if one or more organs do not have enough yang energy, they will start under-functioning, and soon symptoms will arise.  If the digestive system is affected, this will most often arise as chronically loose stools.  Cold in the digestive system can also cause severe abdominal pain. If the kidneys are affected, there can by urinary incontinence, dribbling urine, low back pain, or sexual dysfunction such as impotence or simply low sex drive.  There may be dizziness and general weakness accompanied by fatigue. A cold liver will often cause severe menstrual cramps.

Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicinals are extremely effective for treating these conditions, all without harmful or invasive procedures, and while strengthening the body and preventing the continued development of this imbalance into other organ systems.  If you come in for treatment, we will not only work with acupuncture and herbs to rebalance your system and restore your yang, but we will look at the foods you eat and make sure you&#8217;re prescribed ones that will nourish your yang.
