</h4>

As I sat warm and dry in my home, and then came to my completely untouched acupuncture clinic this week, I felt so grateful that the rains did not make their way too far into the heart of Fort Collins.

But probably all of us, if we were not directly affected ourselves, know someone who has been. A friend of mine spent Sunday helping her friend in Boulder who was shown on the news getting rescued by firefighters as everything she had got washed away below her. A patient yesterday told me someone at her workplace actually perished in the floods.  These stories, and all the rest, just break our hearts, and we feel we want to help in some way.

**In an effort to contribute help where I can, I am offering complimentary de-stressing acupuncture treatment to anyone who has been directly affected by the floods, either through their own homes being damaged or destroyed, or that of a loved one&#8212;or of course, if they have lost a loved one or still have yet to hear from them.  A simple series of 5 points in each ear has been shown to be extremely affective to help alleviate the affects of trauma, and is being used all over the country in veteran&#8217;s hospitals to help treat PTSD, as well as in addiction centers.**

Through the work of Acupuncturists Without Borders, more and more commonly, mobile acupuncture clinics are being set up after disasters such as Katrina and Sandy, just like we had here in Fort Collins during the High Park Fire last summer.  People come in for free, simple treatments, where they just sit quietly in a chair while the needles do their magic.  Patients report feeling much more relaxed and able to cope with what lies ahead, after receiving treatment, and they can come in as often as needed. While so far a mobile clinic has not been set up in FC, people can just call me and we can set up a time for them to come into the clinic.

**Please spread the word in whatever way you can to let people know about this offer for free treatments!** We will not be working on any constitutional or health issues during these sessions, and they won&#8217;t need to fill out any lengthy forms or share their health history. They don&#8217;t even need to make an official appointment through my scheduling system.  It will simply be a way to help deal with any affects of trauma. **Anyone wanting to take advantage of this service can call me at 227-3077 to set up a time to come in during my normal business hours.**
