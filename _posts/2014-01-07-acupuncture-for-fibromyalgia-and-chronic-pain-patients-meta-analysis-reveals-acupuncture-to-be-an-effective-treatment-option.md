## <span style="color: #808000;">Acupuncture for Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain: It works!</span>

**According to a <a title="Study Reveals Acupuncture Effective for Chronic Pain" href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1357513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta-Analysis</a> published by JAMA, a respected medical journal, acupuncture has been shown to be effective for chronic pain. In this study, they compared acupuncture to sham- acupuncture, and found statistically relevant differences in treatment outcomes comparing the two groups.**

What is wonderful about this particular analysis is that the sheer number of cases studied was enormous&#8212;in all the individual studies that were analyzed, there were 17,922 patients included.  **The results showed that the patients who received real, as opposed to sham acupuncture, had statistically significant less pain, including less back and neck pain, pain related to osteoarthritis, and headache (the 4 types of pain that were studied).** 

**Their conclusion was that acupuncture is indeed a good treatment option for chronic pain, and that it can be considered a reasonable treatment option. In my clinic, I see these results every day, and especially enjoy working with patients with fibromyalgia, as I get to see their lives completely turn around once their pain levels consistently decrease.**

If you or someone you know is suffering from chronic pain, why not schedule some acupuncture so we can not only help with the pain, but with all the other issues that begin resolving once the body starts healing, as we work holistically with the body as a whole, resolving the underlying imbalances which are causing not only the pain, but any other symptoms a person is having.
