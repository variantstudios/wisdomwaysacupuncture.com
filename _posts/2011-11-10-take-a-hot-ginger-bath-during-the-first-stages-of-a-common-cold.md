Today I&#8217;d like to share another tip, which can be used right when you first feel the cold symptoms coming on.**

**Many of the herbs that are given to knock out a cold, are diaphoretics, or in other words, herbs that make you sweat.  Chinese Medicine believes that this sweating action removes the pathogen from those outer layers of the body that have been invaded.  For this same reason, acupuncturists often prescribe sweating through baths when a person is not sweating on their own during a cold.**

_**So if you get a cold, pay attention to if you&#8217;re already sweating.  If not, then as soon as possible, draw a very hot bath, throw in a fist sized piece of ginger which has been cut into chunks, (or alternatively a cup of epsom salts if you do not have ginger), and sit in the bath for 15 minutes.  After you get out, without drying off, wrap yourself in your towel and a bath robe, and go and lay under covers for another 5-10 minutes to continue the sweating.  Take a hot shower to rinse off the sweat and dry off.**_

**This treatment is useful for the wind-cold type of common cold, as the cold contracts the pores and inhibits sweating, locking in the pathogen and creating body aches and often stiff necks and/or occipital headaches.  This is NOT a treatment to be used of the body is already feverish, and there is already sweating.  Typically, a person who needs this therapy will have chills rather than fever and the hot bath will feel very good.**

  <strong>Hopefully, we&#8217;re all doing things that are keeping our immune systems up so we don&#8217;t get a cold in the first place.  But if you do find yourself with those tell-tale signs, then this could be an effective treatment to wipe a cold out before it gets a chance to get deep into the body.</strong>
