Since I wrote [an article](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2011/01/08/buying-grassfed-beef-locally-through-sunrise-ranch/) in my newsletter for my acupuncture patients on Sunrise Ranch Grass-fed beef, I thought I would include my latest favorite recipe which does include beef.

**This recipe is loaded with veggies that will build up your Qi and Yang and keep you fortified and toasty during our cold weather.  Also, because it is very slowly baked for 3-4 hours, it is virtually swimming in [warming Yang energy&#8230;and you&#8217;ll like that all you coldies!](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2013/01/11/brrrrrrr-are-you-hypersensitive-to-the-cold-your-acupuncturist-says-you-may-be-yang-deficient-signs-and-symptoms-of-yang-deficiency/)**

**Serve it with some sauerkraut on the side to contain and direct your Qi even deeper inside where it can stay protected and warm.** (For those of you who missed [the article](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2010/12/07/when-eating-more-salt-will-help-conserve-your-qi/) I sent out several weeks ago to my acupuncture patients, sour and salty flavors serve to contain and direct inwards, which is exactly what we want to happen to our Qi in the cold winter months so it does not scatter out and dissipate)  Also, sauerkraut will add a nice balance of soft and crunchy, cold and warm, savory and sour.

*Please know, for those of you who have damp and/or heat conditions, you want to go very easy on beef, or even switch it to chicken in this recipe and let me know how it goes!  Also, because there is quite a bit of red wine in this recipe, even though the alcohol will evaporate out during cooking, those with damp-heat conditions (gout, red/swelling arthritic conditions) will want to go easy&#8230;if you can stand it. :-)

Let&#8217;s give thanks once again to <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=lem6kddab&et=1104078084179&s=0&e=001VPMzYI6b7ar9WEyjKRWHHQkuqK4wiGZ2Oehm8X2oxTFy17klLxhgSMT_QXjJFDprlV0Dh2PUMcQUH7Yvyhoms2DDlDPpquy6q4qrNU9P0oFB-5gLS037qmqxlxBq6wEZvgzHjMTcqUIz_ofls4Ubrb-EKdT2_GcxsgJQa0lb1JAMuIOzAX459mGyv1OD0ojdW00ZESX_vqHZv1ZVMI01X1heIm0z_v9j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamie Oliver</a> for creating yet another fabulous and easy recipe from which I adapted the following!

**Jool&#8217;s Favorite Beef Stew**

**Serves 4**

**Ingredients:
  
** Olive Oil
  
Knob of butter <span style="color: #999999;">(update: since going paleo I substitute pastured lard or duck fat)</span> **
  
** 1 onion, peeled and chopped
  
Handful of fresh sage leaves (I just threw in 1/2 handful of dried)**
  
** 1 3/4 lb. stewing steak or beef skirt steak, cut into 2 in. pieces
  
sea salt and fresh ground pepper
  
flour, to dust meat, seasoned with salt and pepper <span style="color: #999999;">(update: since going paleo I just omit, or use coconut, cassava, or almond flour)</span>
  
**Veggies:**
  
(adapt all following veggies to whatever hardy ones you have at home&#8230;I&#8217;ve just been cutting up different types of squash and using that since that&#8217;s what I got locally at the Farmer&#8217;s Market last time I was there)
  
2 parsnips, peeled and quartered
  
4 carrots, peeled and halved
  
1/2 a butternut squash, halved, deseeded and roughly diced
  
handful Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and halved
  
1 lb. small potatoes (damp patients use sweet potatoes)
  
2 tbs. tomato puree
  
1/2 bottle red wine!
  
1 1/4 cup organic beef or veggie stock
  
zest of one lemon, finely grated
  
a handful of rosemary for serving, leaves picked off
  
1 clove of garlic for serving, peeled and finely chopped

Preheat oven to 300. Prepare all veggies as stated above, but you can wait to prepare the rosemary, lemon zest, and garlic until you are getting ready to pull stew out of the oven. *Don&#8217;t skip these ingredients though&#8230;they are essential for this recipe to knock your socks off!

Put a little oil and knob of butter into large casserole that can go from stovetop to oven.  Add onion and sage and fry for 3-4 minutes.  (At this point, make sure you stop and sniff the air with a satisfied feeling of  importance as the unexpectedly amazing aroma wafts through your kitchen&#8230;if you have a glass of red in hand, the importance of the moment will be surely enhanced&#8230;)  Toss the meat into a little seasoned flour, then add it to pan with all the veggies, tomato puree, wine and stock, and stir together.  Season generously with plenty of black pepper and add just a little salt.  Bring to a boil, place a lid on top, then cook for 3-4 hours in the oven until meat is tender.  Depending on how fresh your meat is and the cut you&#8217;re using, this will take more or less time.  Test it by mashing up a piece of meat and if it falls apart easily, it&#8217;s ready.  Once it&#8217;s cooked, turn the oven down to 225 to keep the stew warm if you&#8217;re not quite ready to eat yet.

Serve by ladling big spoonfuls into a bowl and placing on a plate with sauerkraut on the side.  (Jamie recommends serving with fresh, warmed bread&#8230;which of course is also good but not as medicinal)  Mix the lemon zest, rosemary, and garlic together and sprinkle over each person&#8217;s stew bowl before eating&#8230;just the smallest amount will make a world of difference, and as soon as it hits the hot stew it will release an amazing fragrance.

Best served with people you love. :-)

Enjoy!**
