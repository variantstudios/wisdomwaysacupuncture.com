An [acupuncture study](http://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1780-acupuncture-alleviates-menstrual-pain-in-australia) in Australia confirmed what I see clinically with so many of my patients: that acupuncture is very beneficial for menstrual/period pain.

They found that acupuncture was “effective for reducing both pain intensity levels and the duration of menstrual cramping and pain. In addition, the researchers document that acupuncture reduces secondary symptoms including back pain, headaches, and nausea.”

There are so many things I love about this report:

##### First: it reflected what I see clinically as well:

That when a woman has bad menstrual cramps, treatments received as close as possible to the time of her actual period, are very effective. When we’re just treating generally throughout the entire month, while that may be addressing all the other issues a woman is coming in for, to really have good results with period pain, the best method is to treat right around the period itself.

#### Second: The women received 12 acupuncture treatments.

I’m not sure how this phenomenon occurred, but there is definitely a “thing” here in the US where people have the impression that acupuncture has to almost work like magic — alleviating sometimes severe and year’s long symptoms in just a few treatments — or the treatment “isn’t working”.

I’ve seen no study where the efficacy of the treatment was tested after just a few treatments, so this study gives a much more realistic expectation for what women can plan for when considering starting acupuncture for their menstrual pain. (or for anything, really).

I’m always clear to point out though that it’s not that my patients aren’t going to notice improvement along the way. It's just that since we’re actually working to heal the condition and not just mask it, the medicine — and their bodies — definitely need time for those deep changes to occur.

The point is, understanding how the treatment actually works and therefore what they can expect in their treatment plan, helps women feel more confident and trusting in the process.

#### Third: So many other symptoms improved as well!

Specifically mentioned above were: back pain, headaches, and nausea. Since acupuncture is working holistically, we’re never just working on one level or symptom. That’s why addressing one issue means so&nbsp; many are automatically getting addressed at the same time.

Whenever I hear about women suffering with menstrual pain, it’s always very sad because I&nbsp; know that in most cases, it’s simply so unnecessary. I just want to get them on my treatment table and prescribe them some herbs to make the treatment even more effective! :-)
