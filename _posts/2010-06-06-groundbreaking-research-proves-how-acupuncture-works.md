**A scientific breakthrough has finally been able to prove how acupuncture works.**

What I love about this, is that it is no longer _if_ it works, but _how_ it works.

This is an enormous distinction to make, and a huge step forward for all of us who want and deserve safe, non-invasive, effective medicine.

While research like this may seem somewhat silly to those of us who have been working with the medicine for many years, and everyday see patients return completely relieved of their ailments, the implications of this are nonetheless profound.

Dr. Morry Silberstein of the Curtin University of Technology, who will publish his research in the Journal of Theoretical Biology later this year.(1), said,

  <em>“We have never really had a scientific explanation for how acupuncture actually works,” he said. In the absence of a scientific rationale, acupuncture has not been widely used in the mainstream medical community. If we can explain the process scientifically, we can open it to full scientific scrutiny and develop ways to use it as a part of medical treatments.”</em>

**Acupuncture for pain relief is actually being taught to American Air Force physicians deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan** (2009) by Dr. Richard Niemtzow MD, PhD, MPH and editor of Medical Acupuncture. His technique called “Battlefield Acupuncture” relieves severe pain for several days and is a variation of acupuncture, which inserts very tiny semi-permanent needles at specific acupoints on the skin of the ear that block pain signals from reaching the brain.

  <em><strong>“This is one of the fastest pain attenuators in existence,” said Dr. Niemtzow, who is the Consultant for complementary and alternative medicine for the Surgeon General of the Air Force, and is affiliated with Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda. “The pain can be gone in five minutes.”</strong></em>

It has taken many years for the western medical world to accept acupuncture as a bonafide, legitimate form of medicine, but **with research like this continuing to pour forth from the laboratories, our scientists will continue to discover what the Chinese have known for thousands of years…that acupuncture works!**
