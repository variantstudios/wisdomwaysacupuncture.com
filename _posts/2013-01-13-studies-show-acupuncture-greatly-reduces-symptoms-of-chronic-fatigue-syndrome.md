New studies being reported on by Acufinder.com show that acupuncture (and other treatments also commonly administered during acupuncture sessions) has a dramatic and beneficial effect on symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).

From their article, “Patients ranging in age from 28-54 received sliding cupping treatments twice a week for a total of 12 treatments. &nbsp; The results showed there was vast improvement in fatigue levels, insomnia, poor memory, spontaneous sweating, sore throat, profuse dreams, poor intake, abdominal distention, diarrhea, and alternating constipation and diarrhea.”

Another random study divided CFS sufferers into an acupuncture and a control group. The acupuncture group actually received acupuncture and the control group received an injection.&nbsp; After the study, 28 research papers were scientifically reviewed using meta-analysis to analyze the success of the acupuncture treatments, and the results reveal that the acupuncture group did fare much better than the non-acupuncture group.&nbsp; Additionally, when participants completed a “fatigue scale” after the study, the acupuncture group scored much higher than the control group, indicating their symptoms of fatigue were much lower than the sham acupuncture group.&nbsp; One of the common symptoms among the CFS sufferers was headaches, and the acupuncture group reported that their headaches were half the rate of those in the control group.

In my practice, I treat a large number of patients with CFS. Often, they haven’t been diagnosed with this, but when we look at their symptoms, (extreme fatigue that gets in the way of basic functioning, brain fog, hypersensitivity to environmental stimulants, digestive issues, headaches/migraines, muscle aching and weakness), we see that they do fit the diagnosis.&nbsp; Getting this diagnosis can be very frightening for people, as they know this syndrome can last for years, and there is no known cure.

Luckly, using a combination of acupuncture and Chinese herbs, we are able to treat not “Chronic Fatigue”, but their individualized “pattern of imbalance” as diagnosed with Chinese medicine, and which is showing up as the western diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue.&nbsp; In&nbsp; my practice, each CFS patient has a different Chinese medical diagnosis, and simply needs to have imbalances corrected in their system.&nbsp; This is where Chinese medicine excels.

If you are suffering from CFS, I would highly recommend finding a licensed acupuncturist in your area, so you can start getting the treatment needed to give you back your life.&nbsp;

Be sure to find one who specializes in internal medical issues rather than orthopedic/injury problems.&nbsp; They will be much better trained and experienced in getting to the root of your complex symptoms. Also, make sure that they went to an accredited 3 or 4 year Chinese medicine University, and that they are certified by either their state acupuncture board, or by NCCAOM, the national certification agency that then enables people to receive medical licensing by their state.&nbsp; DO NOT GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR, MD, OR PT for acupuncture for chronic health issues.&nbsp; They will NOT know what they are doing, unless they have also received the above training and certifications in addition to their western degrees.
