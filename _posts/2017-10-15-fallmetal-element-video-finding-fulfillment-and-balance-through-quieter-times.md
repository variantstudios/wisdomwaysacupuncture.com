In this 5 Elements video I discuss the [Metal Element](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2016/11/05/metal-season-the-time-for-learning-about-letting-go-but-that-whats-of-value-remains/), related to the season of the Fall. It includes just a few [correlations related to the Metal element](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2011/10/05/time-to-inspire/) — mostly focused on the [emotional/spiritual aspects of Metal](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2011/10/26/what-we-learn-from-the-leaves-as-they-leave/) — and gives a few tips on how to draw on the gifts of the other elements to help balance a Metal element that needs some help.

Remember though that the elements are about so much more than a short video can discuss! To learn more about the elements please do a search on my website for “metal element” or follow the above links, to read more articles I’ve written about it.
