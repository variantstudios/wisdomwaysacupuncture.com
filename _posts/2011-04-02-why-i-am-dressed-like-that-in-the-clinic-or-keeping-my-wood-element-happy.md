OK, well you may not exactly see me dressed _quite_ like the picture to your left &#8230;but what you _will_ likely notice when you come in for your treatments is that I will not always be dressed in my usual business/professional clothes.

**Why is this?  Because I&#8217;m wanting to practice what I preach, and be one more reminder for what we ALL need to be doing: staying fit. ** 

**Like many people, for me, finding time and motivation to exercise on a regular basis is somewhat daunting.**

Eating healthy?  No problem.  Cooking for sometimes hours per day?  No sweat.  But get me to consistently hit the trails running, or the gym, is another issue.

**<span style="color: #808000;">Wake Up Call and Call to Action</span>**

Consequently, last week I stepped on my scale which measures body fat percentage, and the number that showed up on the little digital screen was frightening. Over 31%!  Whoa!  Now I&#8217;ve always known I&#8217;m not the most muscle bound in the room, but 31%!  That&#8217;s just downright unhealthy.  So I&#8217;ve decided to do something about that, and what more perfect time of year than Wood season, when our Liver wants a GOAL and something it&#8217;s setting its vision on to accomplish?

**Since it&#8217;s Spring, that means according to Chinese Medicine we are flying full speed ahead through the [Wood Element](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2018/05/15/ready-set-wood-season-what-acupuncture-theory-has-to-say-about-spring/).  Any of you who have been my patients for a couple seasons have heard me talk a LOT about the [challenges that the Wood season brings](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2018/04/15/wood-element-agitation-tips/). ** 

**Think of Type-A energy on steroids, all around us, every day.  Everything in nature is about to burst forth, letting nothing stop its explosive and expansive rise towards the sun.  This is _a lot_ of energy that we&#8217;ve got backing us up at this time of year.  If we don&#8217;t use it, rather letting our own energy stagnate; frustration and blockage, both physical and emotional, are sure to follow.  What this can look like is increased symptoms related to liver issues (I trust if you&#8217;re MY patient, you know what this means&#8230;) :-)  Not pretty.**

So I just signed up to do the BolderBoulder again this year, which means I&#8217;m on a training program that will ideally get me back down to my humble aspirations of 23% body fat.  I probably won&#8217;t get there in the 9 weeks before the race, but that&#8217;s OK&#8230;all my liver wants from me is a goal and a vision, and to be actively headed towards it.

I believe wellness is about how we feel, not a number, so I&#8217;m really not too concerned about hitting a certain target.  When I take great care of myself, the numbers naturally reflect this whether I check them or not, so my focus is really on the choices I&#8217;m making rather than reaching a destination.

**<span style="color: #808000;">My clinic wardrobe will be modeling my goals</span>** 

**Therefore, I will be donning fitness gear a few days per week in the clinic.  Not only because I want one less excuse to not ride my bike to work, or head to the gym or out for a run as soon as I leave, but because I want to be a reminder for all of us that we can integrate healthy lifestyles into our normal and busy lives.**

Now I know not everyone has the freedom I have as a business owner to dress however I please.  However, I also value and deeply respect the trust that my patients give me everyday in caring for their wellness, and that just because I CAN dress however I please, doesn&#8217;t mean I SHOULD&#8230;or that it&#8217;s good for my practice.

I know that attire can say a lot about our intentions and how seriously we take our work.    Slovenly dress is just not acceptable.  Luckily, that&#8217;s not exactly what I&#8217;m going for here.

**I figure my new attire will serve as a conversation piece, keeping me motivated, the conversation about fitness &#8220;up&#8221; as people inquire into how I&#8217;m doing with my training, _but also maybe inspiring some of you who also need a goal this Wood season, to dust off your creative thinking caps and figure out what yours will be._ My clothing will be symbolic of what I&#8217;m doing this Wood season to keep my liver balanced.** 

So&#8230;I look forward to seeing you while I don my fitness gear, and I promise&#8230;I will always shower before heading to work after a run. :-)

**And, if I see you over the next several weeks, I&#8217;d love to hear what YOUR vision will be that will carry you forward with inspiration this Wood season.**
