**It&#8217;s actually just sweet potatoes with eggs. That&#8217;s practically it! All I added were some sunflower seeds and flax seeds sprinkled on top, along with a little salt and pepper to give it some flavor.**

**In my acupuncture practice, [I am often advising that patients get wheat and other inflammatory foods out of their diet](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2013/07/11/to-grains-or-not-to-grains-that-is-the-question-part-i/), which leaves people wondering&#8230;what do I do for sandwiches? A quick snack? Muffins? Breakfast waffles? Hamburger buns?**

**By using this same basic recipe of 2 whipped eggs to every one cup of shredded or pulverized (in a food processor) Hannah Sweet potatoes, you can make whatever you&#8217;d like out of it.  So far I have made: [hamburger buns](http://www.wisdomwaysacupuncture.com/2014/01/21/another-acupuncturist-approved-amazingly-yummy-and-filling-non-grain-bunpancake-recipe-perfectly-balancing-for-cold-winter-months/ "Another Acupuncturist Approved, Amazingly Yummy and Filling Non-grain “bun/pancake” Recipe, Perfectly Balancing for Cold Winter Months"), pancakes, waffles and muffins (add blueberries and cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves); and now the latest, bread. I simply poured the &#8220;batter&#8221; into a buttered bread tin and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.**

[<img class="alignright  wp-image-1991" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-150x112.jpg" alt="acupuncture slice of non-grain bread" width="251" height="188" srcset="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-150x112.jpg 150w, /assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-300x225.jpg 300w, /assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" />](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926.jpg)**To the right you can see what it looks like sliced. Just grab a slice, pop in the toaster and smear some butter on top for a yummy, healthy, paleo treat! Add some greens to the loaf for added nutrients.**

**Our next experiment is going to be this exact same recipe, only with shredded carrots and carrot cake spices to make &#8220;carrot cake&#8221; out of it. Still, no flour, no sweetener. Just all healthy, yummy, veggie full goodness! Updates to follow as I try it out!**
