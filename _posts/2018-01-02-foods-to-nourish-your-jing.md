**Acupuncturists know that we want to do everything possible to avoid tapping into and therefore depleting our Jing &#8212; the root of all energy &#8212;, so this** **week,  I will go into a little bit more detail on some foods you can eat to keep your Jing strong.** 

**While Acupuncture theory believes that there is no such thing as having too much Jing, and  therefore** **that** **all of us can benefit from eating the right foods; please remember that there is never one food or food type that is right for everyone!** You are all different, and some of the foods in this email are completely inappropriate depending on your own diagnosis.  If you&#8217;re my patient, you should know what you&#8217;re diagnosis is, so follow the guidelines accordingly.

  <strong>If you&#8217;re confused about what you need, you can still nourish your jing simply by eating foods that will strengthen your digestive organs </strong>(refer back to my Earth Element/Late Summer blog entries),<strong> thereby enabling them to get the most nutrients out of your food as possible, which will prevent you from depleting your jing.</strong> A clean eating diet composed of tons of veggies and real, unprocessed food, will give those digestive organs lots of nutrients to send out once they&#8217;re strong and able to do the job.<strong> In fact, that is actually the BEST way to prevent jing depletion in the first place</strong>, since there is no one food alone that will sufficiently nourish Jing.  As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention&#8230;

      <strong>1.  Micro-algae products: chlorella, spirulina, wild blue-green</strong>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        For those who run hot, and/or have a history of a toxic lifestyle that needs to be cleansed from their system.  Do NOT eat these foods if you feel cold often, they are too cold and cleansing!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2.  Fish, liver, kidney, bone and its marrow </strong></span>
  </div>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #000000;">Brain is actually also a Jing nourisher&#8230;if you have courage to try it, let me know!!!</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #000000;">A great way to use bones is to get an organic grass-fed bone from either the butcher or a local meat source, and just simmer it slowly for a few hours in water to make a broth.  You can either simmer it so long that it becomes a gelatin that you can refrigerate for several days and add spoonfulls to soups and stir-frys, or just simmer it for a handful hours and continue adding water as it cooks down, to make into a broth to be used for soup. Paleo followers have another way of making bone broth that is also valuable. You can read about that <a href="http://stupideasypaleo.com/2014/07/23/bone-broth-101-how-to-make-best-broth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and on many other Paleo blogs.<br /> </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #000000;">Very important that ALL organ meats be eaten organically exclusively.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><a>3.  Almonds<br /> 4.  Royal Jelly and Bee Pollen, as I wrote about last week.</a></strong> </span></p> 
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> When I have it, </span><a><span style="color: #000000;">I like to add bee pollen to my Nutri-bullets. But careful with smoothies! In the winter even more than the summer, we really shouldn&#8217;t be doing much cold foods or drinks at all. Cold damages the digestive Qi, depletes the Kidney yang (and remember the Jing is related to our Kidneys&#8230;we want our Kidney energy as strong as possible&#8230;and WARM in the winter!). I usually put greens and frozen fruit in my Nutri-bullet, (and whatever else I&#8217;m adding) and then fill it with hot enough water to wilt the greens and bring the frozen fruit to room temperature.  I know&#8230;this is going to seem gross to fanatics of cold drinks, but our obsession with iced drinks in this country does nothing for our health! </span></a>
