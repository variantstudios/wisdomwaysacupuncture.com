What do YOU think that is in the photo?

Looks like bread…

Tastes like bread…

Feels like bread…

It’s not bread! No gluten, no unhealthy substitutes like potato or corn starch. No grains at all.

## Paleo Bread

It’s actually just sweet potatoes with eggs. That’s practically it!

All I added were some sunflower seeds and flax seeds sprinkled on top, along with a little salt and pepper to give it some flavor.

In my acupuncture practice, [I am often advising that patients get wheat and other inflammatory foods out of their diet](/2018/03/15/ready-set-wood-season-tips-for-staying-balanced-in-spring/2013/07/11/to-grains-or-not-to-grains-that-is-the-question-part-i/), which leaves people wondering…what do I do for sandwiches? A quick snack? Muffins? Breakfast waffles? Hamburger buns?

By using this same basic recipe of 2 whipped eggs to every one cup of shredded or pulverized (in a food processor) Hannah Sweet potatoes, you can make whatever you’d like out of it.&nbsp;

So far I have made: [hamburger buns](/2014/01/21/another-acupuncture-paleo-practitioner-approved-amazingly-yummy-and-filling-non-grain-bunpancake-recipe-perfectly-balancing-for-cold-winter-months/ "Another Acupuncturist Approved, Amazingly Yummy and Filling Non-grain “bun/pancake” Recipe, Perfectly Balancing for Cold Winter Months"), pancakes, waffles and muffins (add blueberries and cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves); and now the latest, bread. I simply poured the “batter” into a buttered bread tin and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.

[![acupuncture slice of non-grain bread](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-150x112.jpg){: srcset="/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-150x112.jpg 150w, /assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-300x225.jpg 300w, /assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"}](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3926.jpg)

Here you can see what it looks like sliced. Just grab a slice, pop in the toaster and smear some butter on top for a yummy, healthy, paleo treat! Add some greens to the loaf for added nutrients.

Our next experiment is going to be this exact same recipe, only with shredded carrots and carrot cake spices to make “carrot cake” out of it. Still, no flour, no sweetener. Just all healthy, yummy, veggie full goodness!

Updates to follow as I try it out!
