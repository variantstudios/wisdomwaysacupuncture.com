    &#8230;and how it affects your acupuncture treatments.

Whether you&#8217;re for or against the Affordable Care Act, for good or for bad it&#8217;s on its way. **Fortunately for patients who prefer to receive their medical care through complementary health care providers like acupuncturists, this may bring with it some positive changes in regards to your access to these practitioners. While no one knows** **exactly** **what this is going to look like and how it&#8217;s really going to play out, this blog outlines what we do know about some specific aspects of the law that will affect your acupuncture treatments and payment options.**

## <span style="color: #808000;">Below are listed some of the key aspects of the law that pertain to acupuncture:</span>

### <span style="color: #993300;">Section 5101: Acupuncturists now included in the healthcare system</span>

The definition of healthcare providers originally did not specifically include the Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) profession within its scope. That was changed, and **now acupuncturists are officially part of the future healthcare system. This is very exciting and huge progress for the entire world of acupuncture!**

### <span style="color: #993300;">Section 2706: The key point here is Non-Discrimination in healthcare.</span>

Specifically this section says: &#8220;A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall not discriminate with respect to participation under the plan or coverage against any health care provider who is acting within the scope of that provider&#8217;s license or certification under applicable state law&#8221;. One thing this means, for example, is that **insurance providers will no longer be able to tell patients that they will only pay for their treatment from one type of provider; for example, their nubulizer treatments for asthma from their PCP, but not their acupuncture treatments for asthma. This also means that they must include ALL health care providers that are licensed within a particular state, including acupuncturists, chiropractors, etc; and that insurers will be required to allow enough providers into their networks to match and fill the need in each community for those providers.**

    <strong>The take-home point in all of this is </strong><strong>that</strong><strong> now patients will have much greater choice in terms of choosing a modality with which to treat their health needs</strong>. For example, a patient with migraines can go to a DO, chiropractor, massage therapist, acupuncturist, or naturopath (as long as these providers are recognized and licensed in their state), and will not be limited to the current common choices of their PCP and then a neurologist. A pregnant woman can now choose a midwife instead of being limited to a western gynecologist for her birthing care. MDs are no longer being treated as the gold-standard and only &#8220;real&#8221; form of medicine!

### <span style="color: #808000;">Is this all too good to be true?</span>

**This sounds great, however, there are several loopholes regarding practitioner reimbursement rates and other potential exclusions which still leave confusion as to how this will play out. Also, there are questions as to whether this will actually even be enforced, as regulation has not been issued but is being left up to self-implementation&#8212;which means these issues could leave this non-discrimination section mute.** The health insurance issuers are expected to implement this section using a &#8220;good faith, reasonable interpretation of the law&#8221;. (Ummm, yeah&#8230;we&#8217;ve always been able to rely on insurance companies to use good faith and reason, right??? It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens with this one). :-)

**Also, just because acupuncturists and other CAM providers such as chiropractors and midwives will now be included in the provider lists doesn&#8217;t mean that a patient will have access to them; for example the lower priced plans that are just for catastrophic needs and have high deductibles will likely mean that those patient&#8217;s treatments will still not be covered most years.**

### <span style="color: #808000;">The long and the short of it</span>

**With all this said, if the original intent of interpretation of this law is implemented, it could still be a huge benefit to the large and growing group of people who wish to use acupuncture as a primary form of medical treatment, by increasing access to providers and lowering the cost of treatments for patients.** 

### <span style="color: #808000;">Will your treatments at my office specifically be covered?</span>

So which health plans are included in the new law, in relation to the above mentioned sections? Any market-based plan and those bought on the health insurance exchanges, as well as any self-insured plans normally administered by large employers.  Also, some plans will be grandfathered into the new law, so your current plan, should you stay on it, may be included in these new rules.  You have probably already received a letter from your insurer, advising you as to what is going to happen with your plan. If there are no changes, then your current level of coverage would still apply after the new year.

**Many of you who have been reading my emails over the past few months, or who are currently coming to see me, know that I have been hard at work switching over to accepting insurance and getting everything ready for that; with the help, luckily, of a very experienced insurance biller.** She is keeping herself as up to date as possible with all the changes that will soon be coming down the pike. Even with that, she is informing me that there are many things that insurers say they simply &#8220;don&#8217;t know yet&#8221;.  So **at this point we&#8217;re doing the best we can with learning about the new law and everything it will mean for our patients, and hoping it turns out to be a benefit for everyone involved in the complementary health care field, including you!**

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>So with that, we move forward and hope for the best!</strong>
