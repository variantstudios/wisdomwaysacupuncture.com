Acupuncture has a regulatory effect on the body. &nbsp;We call it “balancing”. Studies have shown that when hormonal blood panels were taken before and after a course of acupuncture, they improved or even completely balanced themselves out. It is common for women to come to their first appointment with their irregular hormonal test results, and have those improve on retesting as the months of treatment go by. &nbsp;Like everything related to actual healing, if she’s looking for an instant, or “bulldozer” effect, acupuncture is not going to be the answer. It takes time for body to “reset” itself and learn to function correctly, when we’re working naturally. &nbsp;Luckily, in the meantime as she’s improving she can expect to experience better energy, moods, sleep, more regular and/or less painful cycles; and just in general an improvement to the symptoms that brought her in. &nbsp;You do not have to be completely “balanced” or healed to start feeling noticeable results.

The good news is, while “imbalanced hormones” may be what brings a woman in, as an acupuncturist I’m not just interested in resolving symptoms, but in resolving the underlying imbalances that were causing the symptoms, so that those same imbalances can’t progress further over time and turn into other worse symptoms or diseases. &nbsp;So we’re working not only on resolution of symptoms, but on prevention.
