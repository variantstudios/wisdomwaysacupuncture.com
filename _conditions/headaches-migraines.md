Acupuncture alone, if someone is able to come in right when they have a headache or migraine, can typically relieve it — if not completely, then dramatically — during the actual treatment.

But while it’s great to get a migraine to go away, what a patient really wants is to be relieved of the imbalance that is causing them in the first place. &nbsp;That is where Chinese medicine excels.

Because of how absolutely debilitating chronic headaches and migraines can be, and conversely how successful I’ve found the treatment, this is another complex health issue that I love to treat. I’ve found treatment to be effective almost 100% of the time.

### Acupuncture treatment for headaches and migraines

Each person has the symptom for a unique reason, and we call that reason an “imbalance”.

Through a thorough diagnostic intake, during which I ask many detailed questions about the rest of the body, I’m able to hone it down to a diagnosis that not only explains the migraines, but any other symptoms a person is having as well. From there, we start treatment with acupuncture.

Depending on the frequency and severity of symptoms, it will take some time to completely rid a person of migraines. But it is not uncommon for migraine meds to at least be able to be reduced within the first few weeks. &nbsp;Typically, after a few months of acupuncture even the most severe patient is mostly symptom free, at which point we have backed down to maintenance treatment mode.

### Chinese herbs for migraines

A few types of migraines lend themselves well to treatment with acupuncture alone, and in those cases, acupuncture alone can be successful. However, most types require herbs, and are difficult if not impossible to &nbsp;treat if Chinese herbs are not brought into the mix. Either way, I almost always like to include herbs in treatment if a patient is open to it, as treatment is generally faster and more successful.

One of the most common issues I treat in my acupuncture clinic is digestive problems.

Whether caused by stress/anxiety, food allergies, auto-immunity, parasites, or just general poor health and weakness, I see great results using both acupuncture and herbs.

And because digestion — and therefore good nutrient absorption — &nbsp;is so important for overall health and wellness, it is vital that we not only improve your digestive problems, but that we address it during the treatment of any ailment.
