### You CAN live without migraines!

When I hear of someone who suffers from regular migraines, I get a pang of sadness because every part of me believes they can feel better!&nbsp; Chinese medicine is so effective at healing migraines that I have absolute faith when someone walks in my door that they CAN improve!

Acupuncture alone, if someone happens to come in in the middle of a headache or migraine, can typically relieve it — if not completely, then dramatically — during the actual treatment. But while it’s great to get a migraine to go away, what a patient really wants is to be relieved of the imbalance that is causing them in the first place.&nbsp;

That is where Chinese medicine excels.

Because of how absolutely debilitating chronic headaches and migraines can be, and conversely how successful I’ve found the treatment, this is another complex health issue that I love to treat. I’ve found treatment to be effective almost 100% of the time.

## Acupuncture treatment for headaches and migraines

Each person has the symptom for a unique reason, and we call that reason an “[imbalance](/2018/06/30/what-does-balance-actually-mean-in-the-acupuncture-clinic/)”.

Through a thorough diagnostic intake, during which I ask many detailed questions about the rest of the body, I’m able to hone it down to a diagnosis that not only explains the migraines, but any other symptoms a person is having as well. From there, we start treatment with acupuncture.

Depending on the frequency and severity of symptoms, it will take some time to completely rid a person of migraines. But it is not uncommon for migraine meds to at least be able to be reduced within the first few weeks.&nbsp; Typically, after a few months of acupuncture even the most severe patient is mostly symptom free, at which point we have backed down to maintenance treatment mode.

## Chinese herbs for migraines

A few types of migraines lend themselves well to treatment with acupuncture alone, and in those cases, acupuncture without herbs can be successful. However, most types require herbs, and are difficult if not impossible to&nbsp; treat if Chinese herbs are not brought into the mix.&nbsp;
