##### The menstrual issues we commonly treat are: irregular menses (meaning timing), light or heavy menses, painful menses, PMS, PCOS, and endometriosis.

Because a normal menstrual cycle is just a function of a healthy overall system, by working holistically on overall wellness, a balanced menstrual cycle is often the natural outcome. This means that while your cycle is improving, so are any other symptoms that are related to same underlying problem as is your menstrual problem.

Often our patients come in with such bad period issues that they’re just medicated with regular hormone treatment so their cycle stops completely, since their doctor had no other treatment option. While this might be a short term fix, it often comes with other issues, including major fertility problems later -- which can be the toughest to resolve.

I typically also prescribe herbal formulas that change along with the cycle, and like all gynecological issues, herbs are typically a vital part of the treatment process if we’re going to get good results.My patients with menstrual problems are almost always able to get off their hormone treatments, if they so choose.

Depending on your situation, I might have you start taking your basal body temperature, which can help us target treatment and gives us another lens through which to look at what is happening at the various stages of your cycle.
