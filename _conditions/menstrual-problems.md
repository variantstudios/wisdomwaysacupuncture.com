The menstrual issues we commonly treat are: irregular menses (meaning timing), light or heavy menses, painful menses, PMS, PCOS, and endometriosis.

Because a normal menstrual cycle is often just a function of a healthy overall system, by working holistically on overall wellness, a balanced menstrual cycle is often the natural outcome.

Often our patients come in with such bad menstrual problems that their doctors have no other option for, so they’re just medicated with regular hormone treatment that stops their cycle completely. While this might be a short term fix, it often comes with other issues, including major fertility problems later -- which can be the toughest to resolve.

My patients with menstrual problems are almost always able to get off their hormone treatments, if they so choose.

Depending on the woman, I might have her start taking her basal body temperature, which can help us target treatment and gives us another lens through which to look at what is happening at the various stages of her cycle.

I typically also prescribe herbal formulas that change along with the cycle, and like all gynecological issues, herbs are typically a vital part of the treatment process if we’re going to get good results.
