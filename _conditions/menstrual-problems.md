The menstrual issues we commonly treat are: irregular menses (meaning timing), light or heavy menses, painful menses, PMS, PCOS, and endometriosis. Often our patients come in with such bad menstrual problems for which western medicine had no other option, that they’re just medicated with regular hormone treatment. While this might be a short term fix, it often comes with major fertility problems later, which can be the toughest to resolve.

My patients with menstrual problems are almost always able to get off their hormone treatments, if they so choose.

Depending on the woman, I might have her start taking her basal body temperature, which can help us target treatment and gives us another lens through which to look at what is happening at the various stages of her cycle. I often prescribe different herbal formulas depending on the phase of her cycle a woman is in, and like all gynecological issues, herbs are typically a vital part of the treatment process if we’re going to get good results.
