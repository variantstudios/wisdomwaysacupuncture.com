If you suffer from insomnia, then you know how horrible it is when you're unable to get a good night's sleep. Especially if the insomnia goes on over time.

Luckily, Chinese medicine can help.

While I commonly treat insomnia, it's often just another symptom we’re addressing along with other primary concerns such as anxiety or hormonal imbalances.

It tends to worsen in menopausal women which explains why it’s a very common problem in my clinic. However, some women are just prone to it from a very young age. Which is actually diagnostic to other symptoms she might also be struggling with.

## Acupuncture & Herbs for Insomnia

In rare cases acupuncture alone successfully treats the insomnia, but most commonly herbs are needed to really get results. The two together have proven the most successful.

Depending on the nature of the underlying imbalance, after the initial consultation I can often predict the likelihood of a woman needing to expect a shorter or longer treatment plan; as I like to be very honest and explain that even successful insomnia cases can sometimes be very tricky to treat. Especially if the insomnia is severe enough that she’s on nightly prescription sleeping meds.

It’s not uncommon however that women are eventually able to get off their sleeping medications.
