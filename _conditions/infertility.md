Chinese Medicine is extremely successful at treating women's health issues, and unlike western medicine -- which usually resorts to hormonal medicines and/or surgery to control many of these issues -- acupuncture and herbs are actually getting at the root of the issue, resolving it at its core.

Whether you're a young woman suffering from irregular or painful periods, or a more mature one who is transitioning into or through menopause, we can help!

See the individual tabs above under "women's health" for more information on these ailments.

We also commonly treat: hormonal imbalance symptoms including PMS, fertility/infertility, endometriosis, abnormal discharges, vaginal infections, itching/burning, pelvic pain, urinary symptoms, and more!
