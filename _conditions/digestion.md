Acupuncture always works by first figuring out how all your symptoms are related to your own unique imbalances. Two people with the exact same digestive symptoms could have completely different underlying imbalances.

Being able to diagnose why you are having your symptoms, and how your imbalances are playing out, is the key to not only resolving your issues, but to treating any accompanying symptoms that go along with your imbalance.

Regardless of what your western diagnosis is, acupuncture looks underneath that diagnosis to find the root cause, and that’s where our treatment is targeted.

### Chinese Herbs for Digestive Issues

I typically combine Chinese herbs with acupuncture treatment for most patients, because I see faster and more dramatic results.

Like the acupuncture points chosen, each herb is chosen not only for its individual effects, but for its synergistic effects with the other herbs in your customized herbal “formula”. The purpose is to help restore balance in the body and to correct that underlying root cause, in order to alleviate and prevent symptoms.

#### Food Allergies, Sensitivities, and Other Nutritional Causes of Digestive Problems

In some cases, it is important to take a look at potential foods that could be causing a person’s imbalances. I always choose a Chinese medicine treatment approach first, but in some cases, figuring out foods which could be playing into a person’s symptoms, and then avoiding them, can help us make huge strides forward in treatment.
