If you’re my patient, then regardless of what gynecological issue you’re coming in for, I will always ask how your cycle is or was. This gives us great insight into what imbalances are lurking inside.

The timing, color, and texture of your bleeding gives us huge clues to solve the riddle of your problems; as do any PMS symptoms or discomfort you experience.

While [period issues](/conditions-treated/menstrual-problems/) are some of the most common gynecological problems we treat, the realm of gynecology includes so much more than just the menstrual cycle.&nbsp;

Other common gynecological issues we treat are: abnormal discharges, vaginal infections, itching/burning, pelvic pain, and cysts or other masses.

### Gynecology treatment in the US vs. China

Unfortunately, Chinese medicine is not used in the US for gynecological issues anywhere near to the extent that it’s able. While studying advanced gynecology in China, I saw it used extensively for issues that in the US we would think of as “too severe” for Chinese medicine; such as [fibroids](/2017/09/03/successfully-treat-fibroids-with-acupuncture-herbs/){: target="_blank"} (up to a certain size), [endometriosis](/2018/05/08/study-acupuncture-effective-for-endometriosis-study-results-and-clinical-experience/){: target="_blank"}, and heavy bleeding.

Chinese medicine is the primary course of treatment in these cases all over China, and using it on my patients with these issues has garnered the same results. Many women have been able to avoid surgeries and other procedures meant to alleviate the above-mentioned, and other menstrual/reproductive related issues.

## Chinese Herbs for Gynecological Issues

Herbs are often a non-negotiable aspect of the treatment for many gynecological issues. &nbsp;Like the use of herbs for any other condition, the herbs chosen will be targeted towards each woman’s specific [imbalances](/2018/06/30/what-does-balance-actually-mean-in-the-acupuncture-clinic/){: target="_blank"}. &nbsp;They might also be given in “phases”, changing throughout the course of a woman’s monthly cycle.

Herbs are so powerful for treating gynecological issues that they are commonly the first-course and only treatment used to resolve these issues in China.
